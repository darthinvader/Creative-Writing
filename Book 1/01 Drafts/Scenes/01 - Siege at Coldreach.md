# 01 — Siege at Coldreach

Goal: Deliver a plea for aid and be believed by proving herself in battle and on the line.
Conflict: Organized sellsword assault (Serathis coin) with alchemical chaff; storm; skepticism; breach attempt at the North Bend.
Turn: Samantha holds a ladder breach in close quarters with disciplined strikes and an empowered smite, buying time for Melf's stonework and Lareth's fire lines.
Outcome: West Gate compromised; ordered withdrawal from Coldreach district to prepare city defenses and coordinate with magistrates; Samantha's expertise now needed for the larger threat analysis and University consultation.

The third bell swung to war when the first ladder hit stone. Samantha took the stairs two at a time, each breath burning her throat in the frozen air. She had come to speak in a council chamber—now a guard with frost-cracked lips redirected her: "If you're a caster, up. We need hands, not speeches."

"I'm an acolyte," she said. "I can help."

Her stomach twisted. *Can I?*

From the parapet the enemy were plain: not an army, a contract. Brigands and sellswords in mismatched mail, their shields steaming in the sleet. Some bore onyx sea‑drake pins—the sign of [[Serathis|Serathis (Eastern Realm)]]. They hauled mantlets and ladders dark with old blood, two siege towers lurching in the wind. Men with slings scattered glittering grit that hissed against stone. Behind them, a ram head of pitted iron waited.

"Alchemical chaff," someone muttered near her, spitting pink-tinged phlegm over the wall. "Salted ash and iron. Foul the catches, burn your lungs if you breathe it."

The grit stung where it found exposed skin. *Ward-staves,* Samantha realized, scanning the defensive positions. The wooden posts with carved spirals were meant to maintain protective barriers, but this powder was designed to disrupt their magic.

A man in a heavy traveling cape had both hands pressed to a fresh plug of pale blocks, his knuckles white with strain. Sweat beaded on his forehead despite the cold, freezing before it could fall. His beard was a grand thing—big, white, rimed with frost that crackled when he spoke—and long silver‑white hair whipped from beneath his hood like banners. The cape itself billowed and folded in clever layers: one of the many from the "cape of capes" he was famous (and teased) for. The fabric whispered secrets with each gust. "Two inches more," he called to the team below, voice cheerful despite the tremor of exhaustion beneath, "and I promise I will stop making these heavier than they already are."

The stone groaned—a deep, primal sound like the earth itself crying out. But the man's expression suggested he heard more than just sound. His head tilted slightly, as if the granite were whispering secrets only he could understand.

She realized the blocks were the wall. The plug had not been there a moment ago. The man—[[Melf Maelstorm]]—touched each stone like a musician tuning strings, and the grain answered with a sound like breaking bones knitting backwards. His fingertips traced the surface with the delicate attention of someone reading braille, listening to something in the stone itself that others missed entirely.

He glanced along the parapet, caught Samantha watching, and raised his brows as if to ask whether she planned to faint. His eyes were the color of winter sky before a storm. "Don't," he said lightly, though she could see the strain in the cords of his neck. "We're very short on fainting space."

"I won't," she said, then, because it itched at her like a splinter beneath skin, "Something's off on that seam. I'm Samantha, by the way."

"Melf Maelstorm," he said with a brief smile. "Professor of Applied Transmutation, when I'm not playing mason."

"Is it?" He pressed two fingertips to the seam and she heard him suck in a sharp breath—the stone bit back. But his expression shifted as if the granite had shared something important, a conversation she couldn't hear. A bead of blood welled on his finger before he smiled as if the wall had told him a joke. Warmth pulsed once in the stone, and with it came the smell of hot granite and ozone. "Better?"

"Better," she said, tasting the metallic aftershock of his working, and moved on.

Along the inner path of the parapet another figure walked as if the wind were merely inconvenient. The ice beneath his boots hissed and steamed with each step. Trimmed beard glistening with melted frost, slick gray hair plastered to his skull—younger-seeming than his years would suggest—eyes that measured rather than glared, cold as the arithmetic of death. [[Lareth Lakhart]] did not posture. He lifted a hand without flourish and a narrow stripe of flame stitched along the snow between two ladders, the heat hitting Samantha's face like an open forge. Not a wave but a precise line that left the air shimmering and her skin tight. Snow flash-boiled to steam that scalded exposed flesh. When grapnels came—metal singing its hunger through the air—he clipped ropes with neat lances that left ends glowing cherry-red, dripping molten hemp. He burned ice beneath boots rather than men when he could, the screams of those who slipped and fell making her gorge rise. The air grew thick with pitch smoke, hot iron tang, and the sweet-sick smell of singed hair and cooking meat where flames found flesh.

Samantha's eyes watered. Her mouth tasted of ash.

She anchored her satchel with her knee, the leather already stiff with cold, and checked the ward-staves set at intervals along the stone. The wood thrummed against her palm like a dying heartbeat. She knew enough to spot when light ran wrong—the way it flickered and dimmed like a candle drowning in its own wax—not enough to name every mark. These read thin, their glow the sickly yellow of infected wounds—insulated, not failing but fouled.

At the north curve a stave dimmed to nothing. The absence of its warmth hit like a slap. Samantha was already shouldering past a bowman whose fingers were blue to the second knuckle, the joints swollen like sausages. His breath wheezed; frostbite was eating him alive. "Excuse me," she said, and set her palm to the spiral. The wood was rough with ice crystals, dusted with the enemy's glittering grit that burned like salt in a wound where it lodged in the cuts.

She took a scrap of oiled wool from her satchel—it reeked of lanolin and old sweat—and wiped the spiral clean. Black residue came away on the cloth. "Counter-mark?" she asked without looking up, her voice tight.

"Short and tight," Melf said, arriving with the smell of wet wool and stone dust. His breathing was labored now, each exhale a plume of frost. "Just snug it; don't redraw the world."

She chalked a small tightening curve where he tapped, the chalk squealing against wood, leaving white dust on her fingers that mixed with blood from her scraped palms. She whispered the smallest of her rites—the kind that steadied candles in drafty chapels—and felt the words pull something from her core, leaving her hollow. The stave brightened with a sound like a sharp intake of breath and held.

"Did they hire alchemists after all?" a student asked, breath fogging. His lips were already turning blue.

"Looks like it," Melf said, wiping blood from his nose with the back of his hand. The wet‑wool smell followed him, mixed now with copper. Up close he seemed carved from winter itself, all silver and white and a grin that warmed cold fingers even as exhaustion carved lines around his eyes. "They're clever—throwing grit where our work is fussy." He spread his hands toward the plug, and she saw them tremble. "I'll keep the shoelaces tied; you two keep the boots on the right feet."

Samantha kept pace between them, her boots slipping on ice slick with blood. "I came to petition the University," she said, having to shout over the wind's howl—"for counsel, and a caster if any would hear me."

"Not on the wall," Lareth said, his tone even as the flame, though sweat carved channels through the soot on his face. "Hold here first. After, speak—and I'll listen."

A crossbow bolt whistled past her ear, so close she felt the fletching kiss her cheek.

"Steady," Lareth said without looking away from the field, though his jaw clenched. "They're clocking how much fire we spend." He glanced at Samantha briefly. "Lareth Lakhart, Marshal of Strategic Defense."

"Samantha Seraphel," she replied. "Herald of Erandia, though that probably means nothing here."

"It will," Melf said from behind them. "After we survive this."

His voice stayed even, but she could see the cost—the way his shoulders hunched, the tremor in his extended hand. Through his Lattice Sight, he could read the precise threads of magical energy like a scholar reading text, stitching flame exactly where he set it—no wider than a boot, no hotter than needed—but each casting left him grayer.

The next push came like a hammer blow: mantlets thumped into place with impacts that rattled teeth; ladders rose like skeletal fingers; hooks bit stone with shrieks that set her teeth on edge. The sound of tearing metal on stone was the sound of nightmares. Lareth rationed flame in tight stitches that melted rings to flesh—the screams were immediate and horrible—and sent men scrambling back with blistered hands fused to ladder rungs. The stench of burned pork made her stomach heave. Melf shifted the wall's grain with a grinding sound like millstones, and when a crack tried to form, he guided it sideways instead of through. A ladder bounced back when its hooks failed to bite, the man at its top falling with a wet crunch that carried even over the battle din.

Magic always asked for breath and discipline; overreach frayed edges or made them bite back through the Lattice's own resistance. She could taste it now—the copper-lightning flavor of power burning its channels through living flesh.

Another stave went dim with a dying wheeze. Samantha cleaned, her fingers numb and clumsy, followed Melf's curt taps for placement, and snugged it before the dullness could spread like gangrene.

"Understood," a voice called from behind them—crisp with military authority. A woman in guard captain's mail strode along the parapet, her weathered face grim with tactical assessment. Her left arm moved stiffly, favoring an old wound that had healed wrong, and pale scar tissue gleamed through a gap in her shoulder armor where the leather had been cut away to accommodate whatever damage lay beneath. She carried herself with the confident bearing of someone who had survived worse than this. "Archers, cover her hands."

[[Captain Aldara]] had been coordinating the defense since the first ladder hit stone, her voice cutting through the chaos with practiced command. Lareth acknowledged her with a nod—the University's magical support working under her tactical authority.

They held their stretch. Muscles screamed; tendons pulled taut as bowstrings. The sled‑tower nearest them pitched when a wheel—hastily nailed and badly—sheared its spokes with a sound like breaking teeth. The tower groaned, tilted, and men jumped rather than ride it down. One landed with a leg turning wrong, the bone punching through leather with a wet snap. His howl cut through everything else—primal, animal—until an arrow took him quiet, the shaft sprouting from his throat like a crimson flower. He gurgled, clawed at it, then went still. Blood hit snow and steamed, the iron smell thick enough to chew.

Relief lasted three breaths that tasted of death. Then a knot of sellswords crashed grapnels under a mantlet and rammed a ladder up flush to the North Bend where the wind cut worst, driving ice splinters like needles into exposed flesh. Hooks shrieked on stone—the sound of violation. Three crested the parapet at once—tarred shields smoking in the cold, ice on their beards, eyes like chips of flint, knives for close work that gleamed with promise.

Samantha moved. Training settled her shoulders and emptied her breath, but her heart hammered against her ribs like a caged bird. She stepped inside the first man's guard—close enough to smell rancid oil on his beard, stale beer on his breath—turned his elbow with a wet pop, and struck his helm with her weapon's butt. Metal rang like a broken bell; his teeth pinked his breath in a spray. The second swung low for her guts; she caught the blade on her leather bracer, drove her shoulder into his solar plexus, and stamped his knee. Something gave with a wet pop. He screamed as the joint bent sideways. The third met her eyes, hesitated at what he saw there, and paid for it when her strike caught his throat. Cartilage crunched. He dropped, clawing at his crushed windpipe.

"Left!" a student shouted, voice cracking with panic. Lareth's flame stitched a line behind the ladder—flesh sizzled where it found targets—to keep new boots from finding purchase. The screaming intensified. Melf's hands were sunk to the wrists in stone that flowed like thick honey, coaxing grain to bite the ladder's hooks. Grit hissed against magic; frost cracked like bones breaking. His face was gray with strain, blood running freely from his nose now.

Steel rang—a pure note in the chaos. The first man recovered with a snarl that showed teeth filed to points. His breath reeked of rotting meat. Samantha drew a breath that tasted like snow and smoke and prayer and the copper of her own fear. Something in her chest expanded, pressed against her ribs, demanded release. "Valamar," she said, not loud but true, the word scraping her throat raw.

Light ran up her arm like a bell-note made visible, like lightning given form and purpose. Her skin prickled, every hair standing on end. The sensation was ecstasy and agony combined—power burning channels through meat never meant to hold it. The next strike landed with more in it than muscle—a clean, constrained blow that drove the man back as if the air itself had weight and wrath. His sternum caved with a crack like a tree splitting. He hit the ladder hard enough to rattle every ring in his mail, the sound like a sack of coins dropping. One fell immediately, limbs loose; one clung with fingers that left bloody streaks on the rungs; and the last froze long enough for an arrow to punch through the gap at his collarbone with a meaty thunk. He looked surprised as dark blood bubbled from his lips.

"Smite," Melf said conversationally, as if identifying a bird by its call, though his voice was hoarse. "Useful."

"Measured," Lareth said, approving the restraint as much as the force while wiping blood from his upper lip. "Hold them there."

Samantha held. Not by shouting, not by show, but by placing each step where it counted and making each hit do only the work required. Her body moved on instinct now, training overriding the part of her mind that wanted to curl up and weep. When more hands reached the crenel—fingers like pale spiders—she rapped knuckles hard enough to split skin to bone. The crack was audible. She hooked a wrist, feeling tendons pop beneath her grip, and sent a knife clattering into the yard below where it rang against stone. The empowered hum faded as quickly as it had come, leaving her feeling hollow and brittle as old paper; she did not chase it. She saved it, hoarding it like a last swallow of water in the desert.

Melf breathed out—a long, shuddering exhale—and the ladder's hooks failed to bite. "Shoelaces tied," he said, though his grin was more grimace now. The ladder lurched backward and slid; bodies thumped into the drift far below, dull as sacks of wet grain. Some moved afterward. Most didn't.

Only then did relief last four breaths that rattled in her chest.

From the West Gate came a blow that felt like a drum in the stone, like the world's own heartbeat stumbling. The vibration traveled up through her boots, into her bones, settling in her chest like dread given weight. A long, low horn rolled over the streets—the withdrawal note, mournful as a dying animal. Bells followed in measured sequence, bronze voices calling districts by order toward the inner ways. Each toll was a small surrender.

Captain Aldara's voice rang out across the defensive positions. "West Gate's compromised!" she called, her voice carrying the authority of someone who had been commanding this defense from the start. "Breach in the lower works. We need to fall back and prepare the city for siege."

"Acknowledged, Captain," Lareth replied, already calculating angles and distances while wiping blood from his nose. "How long can your people hold the retreat route?"

"Long enough," she said with veteran certainty, her hand unconsciously flexing near her sword hilt in a way that suggested old pain flaring with stress. "But not much longer. Those alchemical tricks are fouling every ward we've got."

Samantha realized her palm stung where chalk had ground into old scrapes, mixing with fresh blood to form a pink paste. She flexed her fingers and looked to the others. They all looked like they'd been dragged through hell's own kitchen.

"We regroup with the city magistrates," Captain Aldara decided, her tactical assessment complete. "They need to understand what we're facing—this was reconnaissance in force, not the main assault. The real siege will follow." She looked to Lareth, acknowledging his expertise. "The University can brief them on these alchemical countermeasures while we prepare the inner defenses."

"Agreed," Lareth said, already turning, though blood still traced from his nose. "They'll have gone to Redline Three by now—crisis protocols. The University and city authorities need to coordinate defensive strategy."

"The inner walls will hold against conventional assault," the captain added, cleaning her blade with efficient movements that spoke of decades of practice. "This district bought us time and intelligence. Now we prepare for a proper siege."
