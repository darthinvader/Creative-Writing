# Lattice Sight

## Description
Lattice Sight is a specialized magical perception ability that allows the practitioner to see the precise threads and flow patterns of magical energy. It provides extraordinary precision in spellcasting by revealing the exact structure of magical forces.

## Mechanics
- **Visual Component**: Practitioners can perceive magical energy as visible threads or patterns overlaying reality
- **Precision Casting**: Enables exact placement and control of magical effects
- **Resource Management**: Allows the caster to see exactly how much power is being expended and where
- **Efficiency**: Enables minimal power usage for maximum effect through precise targeting

## Applications Observed
### Combat Casting ([[01 - Siege at Coldreach]])
- **Flame Stitching**: Creating narrow, precise lines of fire exactly where needed
- **Resource Conservation**: "Rationing flame in tight stitches" to conserve magical energy
- **Tactical Precision**: Burning ice beneath enemy boots rather than targeting people directly when possible

### Characteristics in Use
- Enables surgical precision in magical application
- Allows the caster to see magical "threads" and manipulate them exactly
- Provides feedback on the cost and efficiency of magical workings
- Can detect when magical effects are being "clocked" or monitored

## Physical Cost
- Sustained use causes nosebleeds (observed in Lareth during siege)
- Leads to visible exhaustion and graying of complexion
- Appears to strain the visual system specifically

## Training and Rarity
- Extremely rare ability
- Requires significant training to use effectively
- May be innate talent enhanced through practice
- Associated with advanced combat casters and precision workers

## Strategic Value
- Invaluable for siege warfare and defensive casting
- Allows maximum effect with minimum magical expenditure
- Enables complex magical engineering and maintenance
- Provides tactical advantage through efficient resource use

## Related Concepts
- [[Magic System#Precision Casting]]
- [[Ward-Staves]] (devices that would benefit from Lattice Sight maintenance)
- [[Rune-Kilns]] (precision magical devices that might require such sight to operate)

## First Appearance
Scene: [[01 - Siege at Coldreach]]
Context: Defensive magic during siege, enabling precise flame control and resource management.
