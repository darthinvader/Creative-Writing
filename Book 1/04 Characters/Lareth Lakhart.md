# Lareth Lakhart

- Occupation: War-trained sorcerer; former highest-rank war mage in Florian; professor focusing on large-scale evocation and battlefield control; practicing astronomer.
- Reputation: Calm under fire; known for giant fire spells and disciplined spellcraft.

## GMC
- Goal: Keep Codaria secure while modernizing the University’s defense doctrine.
- Motivation: Hungry for knowledge and power; left war in Florian to teach, yet conflict follows. When stakes demand it, he turns his drive toward saving students.
- Conflict: Past campaigns in Florian haunt decisions; collateral damage vs. surgical restraint; ambition vs. duty to protect.

## Current Stance on the Book
- Strategic Imperative: To stop Serathis expansion before it hardens into occupation, Lareth is prepared to study and, if necessary, deploy the [[Book of Gosh]] under strict controls.
- Limits & Safeguards: Only as a last resort, with containment contingencies and University oversight; better by his hand than Vaelora’s.
- Rationale: Civilian lives and city sovereignty take precedence over orthodoxy when timelines compress.

## Background
- Florian Service: Rose to Marshal Arcanum (highest war-mage rank). Returned to academia to escape war’s cycle; maintains strategic rigor.

## Abilities
- High-output evocations (fire-centric), counter-siege tactics, unit coordination.
 - Lattice Sight: perceives [[Magic System — The Lattice|The Lattice]] directly—flows and tension; uses this to stitch precise fire lines and prevent misfires.
 - Discipline: cadenced casting and restraint; keeps team work clean and safe under pressure.
 - Capacity & Control: Exceptional capacity paired with battlefield-scale control; steady voice and cadence let him hold large effects without drift.
- Astronomy and timekeeping: sky charts, conjunction tracking, navigation by stars; applies celestial timing to spell planning.

## Appearance
- Trimmed beard and slick gray hair; prefers clean, ordered presentation even in the field.
- Appears younger than his ~120 years due to half-elf heritage.

## Relationships
- Lifelong friend: [[Melf Maelstorm]]; iron sharpens iron.
- New ally: [[Samantha Seraphel]]; takes her claims seriously sooner than most.
- Faculty peer: [[Winter University]].
 - Leadership: Elected High Mage of [[Winter University]] after the death of [[Vera Thricebind (Administrator)]] to guide wartime defense.
 - Defense Coordination: Serves as Defense Coordinator (Marshal of Strategic Defense) prior to election; leads strategic planning and civil defense integration.

## Wounds & Fears
- Wound: War memories; a decisive strike that saved many but cost too much.
- Fear: Becoming a blunt instrument; losing the people he’s sworn to protect.

## Arc Notes
- Act I: Scorches mercenary siege lines, reveals discipline over bravado.
- Act II: Must temper power with trust—lets others take lead when needed.
- Act III: Channels force through community; victory measured by lives preserved.

## Voice Cues
- Sparse words, tactical clarity; less quip, more cadence.
- When cornered by timelines: “We act on the clock we have, not the one we prefer.”

## Moral Fault Line
- Utility vs. Sanctity: Believes controlled use of dangerous tools can be moral if it prevents greater harm; risks sliding into ends-justify-means if unchecked.

## Presence & Charm
- Older, disciplined beauty; posture and poise signal calm command.
- Charm is deliberate and sparing—used to lower defenses without surrendering ground.
- Reads rooms quickly; chooses when to soften tone to keep coalitions functional under pressure.

## Continuity
- Surname confirmed: Lakhart.
