## 2025-09-02 — Beta pass: Scenes 01–06

Overall (brief):
- Strong voice, vivid sensory detail, and clear triad dynamics. Stakes escalate well from wall defense to ultimatum + city occupation threat.
- Watch repetition (burn/stench/stone screaming), a few pronoun POV ambiguities, and timeline wording (“yesterday”) vs same-day events.
- Suggest light trims (10–15%) in two longer scenes (03.5, 04) and add a few clarifying cross-links.

—

Scene 01 — Siege at Coldreach
- Pacing: Fast, kinetic; great alternation of micro-action and ward-fix beats. Trim 2–3 repeated gore/smell lines to keep velocity high.
- Stakes: Clear—breach risk, ward-fouling chaff, West Gate compromised. Nicely escalates to citywide retreat.
- Clarity: One pronoun chain around “his voice stayed even… Through his Lattice Sight…” reads like Melf→Lareth swap; specify subject so Lattice Sight clearly belongs to Lareth.
- Character Sympathy: Samantha’s measured smite and restraint land well; Melf’s humor under strain works; Lareth’s precision is compelling.
- Scene Goal/Outcome: She proves usefulness under fire; earns audience later. Solid.
- Keep/Change: Keep tactile ward fixes and “shoelaces tied” motif; change a couple sensory repeats and clarify who owns Lattice Sight in-paragraph.

Scene 02 — Petition in the Winter Garden
- Pacing: Quiet tension; strong procedural texture (lists, shortages). Flows briskly.
- Stakes: Institutional scarcity vs outsider plea; good micro-stakes (badge, Crucible slot → 5-min audience).
- Clarity: Green Crucible task is crystal-clear. Consider one line to define binder wash goal in lay terms (for non-alchemy readers).
- Character Sympathy: Administrator’s granite pragmatism reads fair, not cruel. Samantha’s “serve where you stand” lands.
- Scene Goal/Outcome: Earns narrow foothold + 5-minute audience. Works.
- Keep/Change: Keep honeyed copper arches/ambient lab detail; change nothing major—maybe 1–2 sentence trim of inventory list.

Scene 03 — The Herald’s Petition
- Pacing: Taut, with clock motif; “five” creeps to ~fifteen—acceptable but keep the time pressure explicit near midpoint.
- Stakes: Macro threat introduced (Silence, multi-realm). Approval for prelim investigation gives forward motion.
- Clarity: Good map + evidence handling. Flag: “held through yesterday’s remaining siege escalations” reads like prior-day—verify timeline (likely same day as Scenes 01–02?).
- Character Sympathy: Melf’s scholarly spark sells belief; Admin’s caution + decision feels earned.
- Scene Goal/Outcome: Approval for prelim + security posture. Solid bridge to 04.
- Keep/Change: Keep “acoustic harmonics” tell; change 1–2 expository sentences to shorter beats to preserve “five-minute” feel.

Scene 03.5 — Bonds of Understanding
- Pacing: Comfortably slow interlude; could cut 10–15% to sharpen (less room description; keep emotional beats).
- Stakes: Emotional—trust, belonging, family exposure. Nicely seeds Melf family leverage.
- Clarity: Clear signals of Winterholme “guardian community” thesis—good foreshadow.
- Character Sympathy: Samantha’s prayer and loneliness resonate; Lareth’s candor humanizes him; Melf’s dad-energy works.
- Scene Goal/Outcome: Establishes nascent bond and shared care. Good.
- Keep/Change: Keep shoelace bit; change a couple long para blocks into 2 shorter paragraphs to aid scan.

Scene 04 — Shadows Beneath Stone
- Pacing: Strong build → overpowering confrontation; fight shows gulf in power. Consider trimming 5–8% of set-up repetition (stone-sense fear called multiple times).
- Stakes: Massive—Tengus ultimatum, ring key, hidden chamber reveal. Great turn.
- Clarity: Reveal of “Vera” is impactful—confirm intentional first-name drop. Ensure door unmaking description stays one-liner crisp.
- Character Sympathy: Trio’s coordination wins points despite loss; Admin’s weariness lands.
- Scene Goal/Outcome: Set 3-day clock; expose chamber and leverage. Excellent.
- Keep/Change: Keep surgical superiority tone for Tengus; change 1–2 repeated “stone screams” lines; add wikilinks to [[Book of Gosh]] and [[Administrator (Winter University)]].

Scene 05 — The Guardian’s Burden
- Pacing: Exposition-heavy but compelling; the reveal sequence is clean.
- Stakes: Book + undead dragon guardian + worthiness test = clear triage ahead.
- Clarity: Very good; suggest early cross-links: [[Book of Gosh]], [[Ward-staves]], [[Redline Three]] if referenced.
- Character Sympathy: Melf’s defense of Samantha is a highlight; Admin’s isolation reads honest.
- Scene Goal/Outcome: Share the burden; define the problem. Solid.
- Keep/Change: Keep moral frame (cleanse vs possess); change 1 paragraph to directly state what failure unleashes (you already do—perhaps bold that sentence or isolate it as a single sentence paragraph for emphasis).

Scene 06 — Lines of Sight
- Pacing: Strategic, cerebral; reads like a clear plan-room scene.
- Stakes: Dual-front threat (Tengus vs Serathis occupation). Good triage framing.
- Clarity: Lattice Sight visualizes ward constellations well. Consider a mini table of “Top 3 priorities” at scene end for reader anchor (you list them in prose).
- Character Sympathy: All three feel competent and human; small humor beats help.
- Scene Goal/Outcome: Assign tasks; commit to sunset sync. Works.
- Keep/Change: Keep triage honesty; change 1–2 sentences to avoid repeating “we can’t save everything” phrasing.

Overall Keep/Change Suggestions (global):
- Keep: Grounded tactile magic (chalk, wash, stone-sense), Samantha’s measured power, Melf/Lareth banter, Admin’s granite tone, clear clock.
- Change: Pronoun clarity around Lattice Sight ownership in 01; verify timeline word “yesterday” in 03; trim repetition of smell/stone scream beats; tighten 03.5 and early 04 setup by ~10%.

Action items (high impact, low risk):
- Clarify Lattice Sight attribution in Scene 01 (one sentence tweak).
- Fix “yesterday’s” vs same-day in Scene 03 if needed.
- Add wikilinks where first referenced: [[Book of Gosh]], [[Ward-staves]], [[Redline Three]]; confirm [[Serathis]] page/alias.
- Trim 3–5 repetitive sensory lines across 01 and 04.
- End Scene 06 with a 3-bullet priority list to anchor reader.

Next-pass priorities (suggested):
- Plot sync: Update `02 Plot/Timeline.md` with the 3‑day ultimatum anchor; ensure Scenes 01–06 dates align (no “yesterday” drift).
- Canon links: Create/verify stubs for [[Book of Gosh]], [[Administrator (Winter University)]], [[Redline Three]], [[Serathis (Eastern Realm)]]; cross-link from scenes.
- Character arc: Add 1–2 beats to `04 Characters/` for Samantha (belonging vs duty), Melf (family leverage), Lareth (people vs plans) reflecting Scenes 03.5–06.
- Worldbuilding notes: In `03 Worldbuilding/Worldbuilding Index - Scenes 01-02.md`, add chaff/binder wash recipe summary and ward-stave counter‑marks.
- Scene polish: Target trims — 03.5 (10–15%), 04 setup (5–8%); reduce repeated “stone screams/stench” lines in 01 and 04.
