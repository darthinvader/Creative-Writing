- **External Requests**: "Not accepting external petitions under Redline Three"
- **Supply Conservation**: Strict inventory control and usage monitoring

## Facility Operations
### Academic Functions
- **Class Suspension**: Normal academic activities curtailed or suspended
- **Research Prioritization**: Focus shifted to crisis-relevant research
- **Laboratory Access**: Limited to emergency and essential projects
