# West Kingdom Emissary (Kandar)

## Overview
A discreet envoy from [[Kandar (Western Realm)|Kandar]] operating under the guise of a trade factor. Their true mandate is to verify that the [[Book of Gosh]] lies beneath [[Winter University]] and secure influence over its disposition to locate the [[Sword of Gosh]]. Travels with letters of passage and an Inquisitor’s sealed writ.

## Public Persona
- Polite, precise, speaks in the language of ledgers and tariffs
- Presents all requests as mutually beneficial trade adjustments
- Maintains deniable distance from church and crown while carrying their authority

## True Objectives
- Confirm Book location and assess University control over sealed chambers
- Broker “protection” in exchange for supervised access to the Book
- Ensure Kandar, not Serathis, gets first actionable lead on the Sword

## Methods & Levers
- Uses rumors, port records, and dockmasters to track vault shipments and ward-stone maintenance
- Offers medical supplies and grain in exchange for academic cooperation
- Cultivates merchant council allies; flatters the pious; pressures the pragmatic

## Personality & Tells
- Keeps a travel journal of meticulous notes; never drinks more than watered wine
- Touches a signet when lying; eyes sharpen when sacred names are invoked
- Avoids direct talk of relics; prefers euphemisms like “custodial stewardship”

## Hooks
- Recognizes [[Captain Aldara]] from Florian campaigns; offers logistical support
- Drops a veiled hint that Kandar already knows about the Book
- Possesses a cipher letter implying the Sword’s locus can be triangulated via the Book’s marginalia

## Appearances (Planned)
- First presence as rumor in [[Timeline#Y1 M1 D6]] / [[09 - Lines of Authority]]
- Formal audience request after initial Serathis escalation

## Risks
- Aid entangles Winterholme in Kandar’s politics
- “Stewardship” could become soft occupation

## Voice
- Measured, courteous, controlled; never threatens, always “offers”
