# Winter Garden

## Overview
The Winter Garden is the central botanical and alchemical research facility of [[Winter University]], featuring an intricate combination of magical infrastructure and carefully cultivated growing spaces.

## Physical Layout
### Garden Beds
- **Design**: Ordered geometric precision under pale sun
- **Paths**: Black basalt edges that absorb and store thermal energy
- **Organization**: Each bed labeled with brass plaques in tidy script
- **Drainage**: Gravel paths with ice crystals that catch and reflect light

### Architectural Features
- **Glasshouses**: Long, ribbed glass structures along inner wall
- **Cloister Integration**: Connected to herbarium cloister via archways
- **Pathway System**: Cinder paths between beds marked with stakes
- **Entrance**: Gate-controlled access from outer cloister

## Magical Infrastructure
### [[Glyph-Arches]]
- **Function**: Copper arches with verdigris patination spanning pathways
- **Purpose**: Maintain liquid water flow through winter via magical heating
- **Operation**: Honey-colored light pulsing slow as heartbeats
- **Coverage**: Central path infrastructure for freeze prevention

### Environmental Control
- **Steam Generation**: Ghost-clouds at ankle height from temperature differential
- **Microclimate**: Controlled environment supporting year-round cultivation
- **Heat Distribution**: Warmth generated and distributed through magical systems
- **Weather Resistance**: Functional in severe winter conditions

## Botanical Collections
### Documented Species ([[02 - Petition in the Winter Garden]])
