# 05 — The Guardian's Burden

Goal: The Administrator must explain the true nature of the threat and decide whether to trust Samantha with institutional secrets.
Conflict: Institutional protocol demands secrecy, but the crisis requires unprecedented cooperation with an outsider.
Turn: Melf's fierce defense of Samantha's right to know, citing her actions against Tengus, forces the Administrator to acknowledge that traditional boundaries no longer apply.
Outcome: The Administrator reveals her role as guardian of the Book of Gosh and the nature of what they're truly protecting, setting the stage for the desperate countdown ahead.

---

The silence that followed Tengus's departure felt heavier than the stone walls surrounding them—walls that whispered their distress directly into Melf's consciousness through his stone-sense connection. He could feel the University's foundations still trembling with residual terror, the ancient stonework struggling to process what had just passed through its halls like a wound in reality itself.

Melf stood watching the Administrator's scarred hands tremble against her desk surface, the crystal ring on her right hand catching light like a trapped star. The sight filled him with protective fury that surprised him with its intensity. How long had she carried this burden alone? How many years had she sat in this office, guarding secrets that left her isolated from even her closest colleagues?

"Three days," Lareth said quietly, his voice cutting through the stillness with surgical precision. Through his lattice sight, residual magical energy still shimmered where Tengus had stood—power signatures that belonged to no mortal tradition, shadows that lingered like stains on reality itself. "We need to understand exactly what we're protecting."

The Administrator looked up at them, her granite expression showing hairline cracks that spoke of burdens carried too long in solitude. Her gaze moved from Melf to Lareth—the colleagues who had shared decades of institutional authority—and then settled on Samantha with obvious reluctance.

"She shouldn't be here for this conversation," the Administrator said, her words carrying the weight of institutional protocol that had governed University business for generations. "This involves matters that predate her involvement, secrets that require clearance levels she doesn't possess."

Melf felt something hot and protective flare in his chest—the same fierce loyalty that had driven him to join the magical assault against Tengus despite knowing they were outmatched. Watching the Administrator dismiss someone who had fought beside them, who had shown courage that had earned his respect even as their combined efforts proved futile, triggered a protective instinct he hadn't realized had taken root so deeply.

Samantha stepped toward the ruined doorway with diplomatic grace, but Melf could see the familiar sting of exclusion in her posture. "I understand. I'll wait outside while you—"

"No." The word erupted from Melf with an authority that surprised everyone, including himself. He moved between Samantha and the door, his protective instincts fully engaged by the weight of injustice being perpetrated against someone who had earned the right to know. "Absolutely not. She stays."

The Administrator's eyes narrowed with the sharp focus of someone unaccustomed to having her directives challenged. "Professor Maelstorm, this is not a matter for—"

"For what?" Melf interrupted, feeling decades of scholarly debate channeling into passionate advocacy. The University's stones seemed to vibrate with his emotion, responding to anger that ran deeper than academic disagreement. "Not a matter for someone who faced Tengus without hesitation? Who stood with us against a creature that made our building's foundations scream in terror, even when we all knew we were facing something beyond our capabilities?"

His voice gained intensity as protective fury transformed into eloquent argument. "She faced down a creature that made our building's foundations scream in terror, and you want to exclude her because she doesn't have the right paperwork?"

Through his stone-sense, Melf could feel the University itself responding to his words—the ancient foundations recognizing truth in his defense of someone who had protected what they all held dear. The building had witnessed Samantha's courage, had felt her divine radiance push back against supernatural corruption, and the stones themselves seemed to approve of his fierce advocacy.

Lareth moved to stand beside him, tactical mind reaching the same conclusion through different reasoning. "From a purely practical standpoint, she's already a target. Tengus knows she exists, knows she has capabilities that concern him, knows she's allied with us." He gestured toward the space where their enemy had stood. "Excluding her from our planning doesn't protect her—it just ensures she'll face the next encounter with incomplete information."

Melf watched the Administrator weigh their arguments, her scarred hands drumming once against the desk surface in a rare display of uncertainty. The crystal ring caught the light, and he found himself wondering how many years she had carried its weight, how many sleepless nights she had spent guarding whatever lay beneath their feet.

"You don't understand what you're asking," she said finally, exhaustion bleeding through her authoritative facade. "The knowledge I'm protecting... it's been hidden for good reason. There are some secrets that sharing only multiplies the danger, only increases the number of people who become targets."

Melf stepped closer to the desk, his scholar's curiosity warring with protective concern for both the Administrator and Samantha. "With respect, Administrator, I think we're past the point where institutional secrecy serves anyone's interests." He placed his palm against the stone wall, drawing comfort and information from the University's distressed foundations. "Whatever Tengus wants from that chamber beneath your office—whatever that ring of yours opens—it's connected to power that threatens far more than University property or institutional reputation."

The mention of the ring made the Administrator's entire posture stiffen, and Melf felt a stab of sympathy for someone whose protective instincts mirrored his own. She was trying to shield them from dangers they couldn't comprehend, just as he was trying to shield Samantha from exclusion she didn't deserve.

"My lattice sight revealed the chamber," Lareth said quietly, nodding toward the floor where hidden spaces existed below the Administrator's office. "The architectural signatures were... distinctive. Whatever's down there is warded with magic that predates the University's construction, power that requires specific authorization to access."

Melf watched the Administrator's face cycle through expressions that spoke of decisions postponed too long, burdens shared with no one, and the terrible loneliness of guardian duty. His stone-sense picked up vibrations of her emotional state—fear, exhaustion, and something that might have been relief at finally having the burden acknowledged.

"I have every right to know," Samantha said quietly, her voice carrying diplomatic authority tempered with understanding. "Not because of institutional protocol or security clearance, but because you've been protecting something that affects all of us. Because you've carried this burden alone when you shouldn't have had to."

The compassion in Samantha's tone made Melf's protective instincts intensify. Here was someone offering understanding rather than demanding answers, someone who recognized the cost of solitary guardianship because she carried her own version of that burden. His academic mind catalogued the parallels—Herald duties that isolated her from normal relationships, divine purpose that set her apart from ordinary concerns, responsibilities that required sacrificing personal comfort for greater good.

"You don't know what you're defending," the Administrator said, but her tone had shifted from bureaucratic authority to something more personal.

"No," Samantha agreed, "but I know what it looks like when someone sacrifices their own peace to protect others. I know what it costs to guard secrets that could destroy people if they fell into the wrong hands. And I know that keeping those secrets has gotten infinitely more difficult now that someone with his level of power wants what you're protecting."

Melf moved to stand beside the Administrator's desk, his palm finding the stone wall in a gesture that had become automatic. Through his stone-sense, he could feel the University's emotional state—fear radiating from foundations that had witnessed too much, anxiety from walls that had been forced to contain power they weren't designed to hold.

"The building is afraid," he said quietly, letting his connection to the University's consciousness guide his words. "Whatever's down there, the University itself knows we're running out of time to keep it safe through secrecy alone."

The Administrator closed her eyes, her scarred fingers finally moving away from the ring to rest flat against the desk surface. When she opened them again, Melf could see the weight of a decision that would reshape everything they thought they knew about their institutional home.

"Thirty years," she said quietly, her voice carrying decades of careful isolation. "Thirty years of waking up every morning knowing that one of the most dangerous artifacts in three realms sits beneath my office, protected by wards that require my willing cooperation to bypass and a guardian that... that shouldn't exist in any sane world."

Melf felt his scholarly curiosity flare alongside growing alarm. Through his stone-sense, he could detect the architectural anomalies Lareth had mentioned—spaces below that hummed with power signatures unlike anything in his experience. "An ancient grimoire," he said, pieces falling into a terrifying picture. "Something connected to the power Tengus demonstrated."

"The Book of Gosh," the Administrator replied, her words falling like stones into still water. "The grimoire was created to contain and control knowledge that was supposed to die with its maker. When the fallen angel Gosh was destroyed, his book survived. Everything he learned about opening gates between realms, about binding demons to mortal service, about trading divine authority for temporal power... it's all there. Waiting."

The revelation hit Melf like a physical blow, reframing everything he thought he understood about the University's true purpose. Through his stone-sense, he could feel the building's long history of careful concealment, decades of architectural modifications designed to hide and contain rather than showcase and preserve.

"That's why Tengus wants it," Samantha said, her voice carrying the weight of terrible understanding. "He's not just seeking power—he's seeking the knowledge to remake the fundamental barriers between realms."

"The chamber below isn't just a vault," the Administrator continued, her voice gaining strength as she finally shared burdens that had been carried in isolation for too long. "It's a prison. The book is guarded by an undead dragon—the skeletal remains of the last creature Gosh summoned before his death. Something that was bound to protect the grimoire until someone worthy of its destruction could claim it."

Through his connection to the University's foundations, Melf could sense the presence she described—something ancient and patient and utterly wrong dwelling in darkness below their feet. The stones themselves recoiled from whatever lay beneath, their natural mineral consciousness unable to process the existence of something that defied every natural law.

The Administrator looked directly at Samantha. "Someone with divine authority sufficient to purify rather than simply possess."

Melf felt protective fury and scholarly excitement war in his chest as the implications became clear. They were asking Samantha to face something that had waited centuries for a worthy challenger, something that could either be destroyed or freed to complete apocalyptic work depending on her spiritual worthiness.

"You think I'm... that I have the authority to—" Samantha began.

"I think," the Administrator said carefully, "that you survived direct confrontation with Tengus when centuries-old wards couldn't slow him down. I think your blessed armor responds to spiritual corruption with protective radiance that belongs to no mortal magical tradition. And I think that if we're going to survive the next three days, we need someone who can do more than just fight—we need someone who can cleanse."

Melf stepped closer to Samantha, his protective instincts fully engaged by the weight of responsibility being placed on someone he had come to think of as family. "What exactly are you asking her to do?"

"What I should have done decades ago," the Administrator replied, standing from her chair with the deliberate movement of someone who had finally committed to a course of action too long delayed. "What I was too afraid to attempt because failure would mean unleashing something far worse than anything Tengus could accomplish with mundane power."

She moved to a section of wall that looked identical to every other surface in the office, her scarred hands tracing patterns that seemed to exist more in memory than in visible reality. The crystal ring on her right hand began to glow with soft light that made the air itself shimmer with barely contained energy.

Through his stone-sense, Melf could feel the wall responding to her touch—ancient mechanisms built into the University's foundation stirring to life after decades of dormancy. The building itself seemed to hold its breath, waiting to see whether its deepest secrets would finally be revealed or remain hidden for another generation.

"The undead dragon below isn't just protecting the book," the Administrator said, her words carrying the weight of terrible knowledge shared for the first time. "It's waiting for someone worthy to end its imprisonment by destroying what it was bound to protect. But if that someone proves unworthy..." She looked back at them, her expression showing fear that went deeper than institutional concern.

"If they prove unworthy, the guardian becomes free to complete Gosh's final working. Every gate the fallen angel ever mapped, every binding he ever catalogued, every demon he ever contacted—all of it becomes accessible to something that has spent generations growing stronger in the darkness below our feet."

The weight of that revelation settled over them like a physical presence, and Melf felt the University's foundations shudder with ancient terror. Through his stone-sense, he could perceive the building's memory of the day the chamber was sealed—the desperate measures taken to contain something that should never have existed, the sacrifices made to ensure that forbidden knowledge remained buried.

Three days to decide whether to risk unleashing horrors that could reshape reality itself, or allow Tengus to claim power that would serve his own apocalyptic ambitions. Melf looked at Samantha—this Herald who had walked into their academic sanctuary and transformed everything they thought they knew about courage and purpose—and felt his protective instincts crystallize into absolute determination.

"We need to understand what we're truly facing before we act," Samantha said carefully, her voice carrying the diplomatic caution that had guided her through dangerous negotiations. "Three days gives us time to prepare properly. Rushing in unprepared could trigger exactly what Tengus wants—either I prove unworthy and free the dragon, or he claims the book while we're recovering from failure."

The Administrator's expression shifted to something that might have been relief mixed with grudging respect. "You're right. Thirty years of carrying this secret alone has made me... hasty. We should plan carefully."

Melf stepped closer to Samantha, his scholar's curiosity tempered by protective concern. "What do you need from us? Research? Preparation? Understanding the specific nature of this worthiness test?"

"All of that," Samantha replied, and Melf could see the weight of divine purpose settling on her shoulders like familiar armor. "But first, we need to understand exactly what Tengus knows and what his timeline really means. If he's given us three days, there's a reason for that specific deadline."

As they began to plan their approach to the sealed chamber, Melf offered his own silent prayer—to whatever forces governed the University's ancient foundations, to the spirits of scholars who had safeguarded knowledge for generations, to anyone who might help them navigate the impossible choices ahead. Through his stone-sense, he could feel the building itself listening, waiting, hoping that this time the burden of guardianship might finally be shared rather than endured in solitude.

Three days to prevent an apocalypse, starting with understanding the true nature of what they faced in the darkness below their feet. The countdown continued, and Melf was determined to ensure that Samantha wouldn't face it alone.
