# Coldreach

- Summary: Frontier port city on the fjord edge of [[Codaria]]; frequent storms, resilient docks, and a wall reinforced by University designs.
- Reputation: Tough, communal, skeptical until convinced.

## Districts & Features
- North Wall — site of the opening siege and ward-stave anomalies.
- Harbor Quarter — ice-scarred pilings; winter fleets pulled to sheds.
- Council Hall — compact, timbered, practical.

## Security & Wards
- Civic sigils tied to hearth-wards; University-standard staves along parapets.
- Recent Issue: "Bleeding" wards consistent with magic-drain patterns.

## Current Events
- Fell after a siege by foreign sellswords covertly funded by [[Serathis|Serathis (Eastern Realm)]].
- Sellswords wear onyx sea-drake pins; West Gate breach forced an organized retreat toward [[Winter University]]. See [[Timeline#Y1 M1 D1 — West Gate breach; withdrawal horn and bells call districts to inner ways; organized retreat toward Winter University. See Coldreach.]].
