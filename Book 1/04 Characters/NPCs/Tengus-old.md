# Tengus

- Summary: A relatively young dark elf sorcerer (~100). Secretly forges a pact with [[Baramoth (Demon God)]] to bring minotaur demons to [[Codaria]], intending this as a test before destroying [[Florian]].

## Motivation
- Power through forbidden knowledge and position; seeks unfathomable power via Baramothâ€™s favor.
- Possible family tie to [[Lareth Lakhart]] makes him a wildcard.

## Abilities
- Sorcery focused on shadow and misdirection; skilled in counter-scouting and arcane negotiation.

## Relationships
- Possible sibling: [[Lareth Lakhart]] (unconfirmed).
- Faction contacts within East and West; observed by agents of the Paladin King.

## Hooks
- May trade critical pages of the [[Book of Gosh]] for concessions.
- Uses Karol-Elf and Melfina as leverage points; Elfina seeks info only he has.

## Fate
- Dies by the hand of [[Samantha Seraphel]] after the Baramoth incursion.
