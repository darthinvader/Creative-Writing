# Future Scene Notes

## Revised Plot Sequence: Tengus Assault

**Setup from Scene 04:** Tengus gives 3-day ultimatum before beginning his "true working" with the artifacts of Gosh.

### New Sequence of Events:

**Tengus's Solo Mission:**
- Tengus assaults the Administrator alone (not waiting for [[Lareth Lakhart|Lareth]], [[Samantha Seraphel|Samantha]], and [[Melf Maelstorm|Melf]])
- Kills the Administrator and takes the ring/key
- Attempts to access the sealed chamber and retrieve the [[Book of Gosh]] and [[Sword of Gosh]]
- **Encounters the undead dragon** in the chamber
- **Fails to kill the dragon** and cannot complete the seal
- **Retreats**, leaving the ring in the dead Administrator's hand
- Exits to formulate new plans based on what he discovered

**Trio's Later Discovery:**
- [[Lareth Lakhart|Lareth]], [[Samantha Seraphel|Samantha]], and [[Melf Maelstorm|Melf]] will **not** go to the chamber before Lareth has the ring
- They go alone **after** the Administrator's death
- Find the Administrator's body with the ring still in his hand
- Attempt to take the [[Book of Gosh]] themselves
- Must deal with the same undead dragon threat Tengus failed to handle

**Key Changes:**
- Tengus acts independently and discovers the full scope of the chamber's dangers
- The ring remains accessible to the trio after Tengus's failure
- Sets up future conflict where Tengus has knowledge of the dragon threat
- Creates opportunity for Tengus to develop alternative strategies

**Timeline:** Administrator's death → Tengus's failed attempt → Trio's discovery mission

*Note: This revision creates more dramatic tension and gives Tengus firsthand knowledge of the chamber's true dangers while preserving the trio's access to the artifacts.*

## West Kingdom Thread (Kandar)

Context:
- Unknown to the protagonists, the West Kingdom of [[Kandar (Western Realm)|Kandar]] has acquired credible intelligence that the [[Book of Gosh]] lies beneath [[Winter University]].
- Their objective is to secure the Book as a locator/decoder to find and claim the [[Sword of Gosh]].

Planned Beats:
- Near-term discussion (next scene): Lareth raises the option of requesting aid from Kandar if Serathis escalates; Aldara weighs political cost versus military necessity.
- Rumor plant: Sightings of a Kandaran trade cog at Outer Harbor; a “factor” asking pointed questions about University vaults.
- Envoy setup: A discreet emissary from Kandar arrives under mercantile cover with letters of passage and an unnamed Inquisitor’s writ; they request an audience when “conditions permit.”

Motivations and Tensions:
- Kandar wants the Book to find the Sword first; they will frame cooperation as holy stewardship and regional stability.
- University fears external control; Lareth’s calculus shifts toward using the Book’s power tactically to stop Serathis before foreign occupation takes root.
- Samantha distrusts relic-use but recognizes the civilian toll if Serathis occupies the city.

Foreshadowing Lines to Seed:
- “If the East tightens the noose, we may need the West to cut it.” — Aldara
- “Help comes with ledgers, and every favor demands payment.” — Melf
- “If the Book can stop an occupation, we should learn how—before someone else does.” — Lareth

Continuity Notes:
- Keep Kandar’s foreknowledge off-screen for now; reveal later via intercepted correspondence or envoy slip.
- Align with Timeline entries on Y1 M1 D6–D7 and Act III’s three-way conflict.
