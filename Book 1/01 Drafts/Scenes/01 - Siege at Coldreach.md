# 01 — Siege at Coldreach

Goal: Deliver a plea for aid and be believed by proving herself in battle and on the line.
Conflict: Organized sellsword assault (Serathis coin) with alchemical chaff; storm; skepticism; breach attempt at the North Bend.
Turn: Samantha holds a ladder breach in close quarters with disciplined strikes and an empowered smite, buying time for Melf’s stonework and Lareth’s fire lines.
Outcome: West Gate compromised; ordered withdrawal toward [[Winter University]] to regroup, brew countermeasures, and hear Samantha’s petition.

The third bell swung to war when the first ladder hit stone. Samantha took the stairs two at a time, shoulder to the press, breath white in the sleet. She had come to speak in a council chamber with a sealed petition and a practiced voice. A guard with a crooked braid had redirected her with a jab of two fingers: “If you’re a caster, up. We need hands, not speeches.”

“I’m an acolyte,” she’d said. “I can help.”

From the parapet the enemy were plain: not an army, a contract. Brigands and sellswords in mismatched mail with tarred shields slick with sleet, some marked by onyx sea‑drake pins—the sign of [[Serathis|Serathis (Eastern Realm)]]. They hauled mantlets and ladders, two sled‑mounted towers lurching in the gusts. An unknown banner hung stiff with ice. At the fore, men with slings scattered glittering grit against the wind so it skittered along the stone like blown sand. Behind them, a ram head of iron waited like a patient animal.

“Alchemical chaff,” someone muttered near her. “Salted ash and iron. Foul the catches.”

A man in a heavy traveling cape had both hands pressed to a fresh plug of pale blocks. His beard was a grand thing—big, white, rimed with frost—and long silver‑white hair blew from beneath his hood. The cape itself billowed and folded in clever layers: one of the many from the “cape of capes” he was famous (and teased) for. “Two inches more,” he called to the team below, voice cheerful despite the cold, “and I promise I will stop making these heavier than they already are.”

Samantha realized the blocks were the wall. The plug had not been there a moment ago. The man—[[Melf Maelstorm]]—touched each stone like a musician tuning strings, and the grain answered. Old mortar creaked, then knit with a ripple like frost taking a window.

He glanced along the parapet, caught Samantha watching, and raised his brows as if to ask whether she planned to faint. “Don’t,” he said lightly. “We’re very short on fainting space.”

“I won’t,” she said, then, because it itched at her, “Something’s off on that seam.”

“Is it?” He pressed two fingertips to the seam and smiled as if the wall had told him a joke. Warmth pulsed once in the stone. “Better?”

“Better,” she said, and moved on.

Along the inner path of the parapet another figure walked as if the wind were merely inconvenient. Trimmed beard, slick black hair, eyes that measured rather than glared. [[Lareth Lakhart]] did not posture. He lifted a hand without flourish and a narrow stripe of flame stitched along the snow between two ladders, not a wave but a precise line. When grapnels came, he clipped ropes with neat lances and burned ice beneath boots rather than men when he could, letting archers do the rest. The air smelled of pitch, hot iron, and singed hair.

Samantha anchored her satchel with her knee and checked the ward‑staves set at intervals along the stone. She knew enough to spot when light ran wrong, not enough to name every mark. These read thin—insulated, not failing but fouled.

At the north curve a stave dimmed. Samantha was already shouldering past a bowman whose fingers were blue to the second knuckle. “Excuse me,” she said, and set her palm to the spiral. The wood was dusted with the enemy’s glittering grit where it lodged in the cuts.

She took a scrap of oiled wool from her satchel and wiped the spiral clean. “Counter‑mark?” she asked without looking up.

“Short and tight,” Melf said, arriving with the smell of wet wool. “Just snug it; don’t redraw the world.”

She chalked a small tightening curve where he tapped and whispered the smallest of her rites—the kind that steadied candles in drafty chapels. The stave brightened and held.

“Did they hire alchemists after all?” a student asked, breath fogging.

“Looks like it,” Melf said, the wet‑wool smell following him. Up close he seemed carved from winter itself, all silver and white and a grin that warmed cold fingers. “They’re clever—throwing grit where our work is fussy.” He spread his hands toward the plug. “I’ll keep the shoelaces tied; you two keep the boots on the right feet.”

Samantha kept pace between them. “I came to petition the University,” she said—“for counsel, and a caster if any would hear me.”

“Not on the wall,” Lareth said, his tone even as the flame. “Hold here first. After, speak—and I’ll listen.”

“Steady,” Lareth said without looking away from the field. “They’re clocking how much fire we spend.”
His voice stayed even, and the flame stitched exactly where he set it—no wider than a boot, no hotter than needed.

The next push came quick: mantlets thumped into place; ladders rose; hooks bit stone. Lareth rationed flame in tight stitches that melted rings and sent men scrambling. Melf shifted the wall’s grain so a crack went sideways instead of through, and a ladder bounced back when its hooks failed to bite.

Magic always asked for breath and discipline; overreach frayed edges or made them bite back.

Another stave went dim. Samantha cleaned, followed Melf’s curt taps for placement, and snugged it before the dullness could spread.

“Understood,” Lareth said. “Archers, cover her hands.”

They held their stretch. The sled‑tower nearest them pitched when a wheel—hastily nailed and badly—sheared its spokes. Men jumped; one landed with a leg turning wrong and howled until an arrow took him quiet. Lareth burned the ice beneath the others’ feet to slow rather than sear, and the city’s fletchers did the rest. Blood hit snow and steamed.

Relief lasted three breaths. Then a knot of sellswords crashed grapnels under a mantlet and rammed a ladder up flush to the North Bend where the wind cut worst. Hooks shrieked on stone. Three crested the parapet at once—tarred shields, ice on their beards, knives for close work.

Samantha moved. Training settled her shoulders and emptied her breath. She stepped inside the first man’s guard, turned his elbow, and struck the rim of his helm with the butt of her weapon—clean, efficient, no flourish. Metal rang; his teeth pinked his breath. The second swung low; she caught on leather bracer, drove her shoulder, and stamped his knee. Something in it gave with a wet pop. The third met her eyes, hesitated at what he saw there, and paid for it.

“Left!” a student shouted. Lareth’s flame stitched a line behind the ladder to keep new boots from finding purchase. Melf’s hands were sunk to the wrists in stone, coaxing grain to bite the ladder’s hooks. Grit hissed; frost cracked.

Steel rang. The first man recovered with a snarl. Samantha drew a breath that tasted like snow and smoke and prayer. “Valamar,” she said, not loud but true.

Light ran up her arm like a bell-note made visible. The next strike landed with more in it than muscle—a clean, constrained blow that drove the man back as if the air itself had weight. He hit the ladder hard enough to rattle every ring in his mail; one fell, one clung, and the last froze long enough for an arrow to punch through the gap at his collarbone.

“Smite,” Melf said conversationally, as if identifying a bird by its call. “Useful.”

“Measured,” Lareth said, approving the restraint as much as the force. “Hold them there.”

Samantha held. Not by shouting, not by show, but by placing each step where it counted and making each hit do only the work required. When more hands reached the crenel, she rapped knuckles hard enough to split one, hooked a wrist, and sent a knife clattering into the yard below. The empowered hum faded as quickly as it had come; she did not chase it. She saved it.

Melf breathed out and the ladder’s hooks failed to bite. “Shoelaces tied,” he said. The ladder lurched backward and slid; bodies thumped into the drift, dull as sacks of wet grain.

Only then did relief last four breaths.

From the West Gate came a blow that felt like a drum in the stone. A long, low horn rolled over the streets—the withdrawal note. Bells followed in measured sequence, calling districts by order toward the inner ways.

Samantha realized her palm stung where chalk had ground into old scrapes. She flexed her fingers and looked to the others.

“We regroup at the University,” Lareth said, already turning. Snow beaded on his slick hair and trimmed beard; he brushed it away with the back of one gauntlet. “They’ll want a plan for countering the chaff, and I intend to hear your petition where I can listen to it.”

Melf rolled his shoulders and the wall answered by settling another fraction. He flicked the edge of his billowing cape as if selecting which layer to wear next. “We can brew a binder wash and a new chalk in under an hour,” he said. “And I’ll file the paperwork later about how I definitely did not do anything the triad should scold me for.”

“You didn’t,” Samantha said, a little breathless.

“Not yet.” He finally allowed himself a small, tired grin. “We’ll save the scolding for when it’s fun.”

They left the parapet to those who knew how to clean and count. Snow was already filling footprints. Below, the sellswords were reforming around a wedge and a ram; above, the bells named streets and routes. “[[Winter University]],” Lareth said, as if it were a direction and not a place. Samantha hugged her satchel close and followed them down.
