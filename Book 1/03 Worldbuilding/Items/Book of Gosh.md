# Book of Gosh

- Origin: Companion to the [[Sword of Gosh]]; records rites of warding, unbinding, and penance from the fallen angel’s path.
- Appearance: Seal-scarred vellum, iron corners, clasp that warms near corrupted sigils.
- Lore: Contains counter-rites needed to purify the sword; some pages are palimpsests that reveal under oathlight.

## Rites & Uses
- Counter-Rite: Steps to sever the gate-binding curse (requires a Herald-paladin and consecrated ground).
- Ward-stitching: Methods to redirect power away from corrupted patterns.
- Oathlight: A reading state available only to aligned oaths (Samantha).

## Risks
- Marginalia may be traps; some inks echo prior corruption if mishandled.

## Current Status
- Believed hidden near the sword’s trail; likely separate cache to prevent easy reunification. Without this book’s rites, attempts to wield the sword risk triggering Baramoth’s minotaur incursion (see: Paladin King incident).
