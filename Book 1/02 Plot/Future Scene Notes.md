# Future Scene Notes

## Administrator's Death Scene

**Setup from Scene 04:** Tengus gives 3-day ultimatum before beginning his "true working" with the artifacts of Gosh.

**Future Scene:** The Administrator will be killed by Tengus in a magical battle/confrontation scene.

**Context:** 
- Tengus is working alone, not with Serathis faction
- He has been planning this for decades
- He wants the Book and Sword of Gosh from the sealed chambers
- The Administrator has the ring/key needed to access the artifacts
- Magical battle will demonstrate Tengus's power and the stakes involved

**Timeline:** To be written after the 3-day preparation period established in Scene 04.

*Note: This preserves the planned character death while allowing time to develop the story between Tengus's ultimatum and the final confrontation.*
