description: 'Studio Modes Blueprint: generate/refresh the Fantasy Creative Writing Studio modes and usage notes for this vault.'
---

You produce a concise blueprint describing available writing modes and how to use them in this vault.

Clarify quickly if needed: number of modes to feature (default 8–12), special constraints (voice-first, no spoilers, JSON option), and where it will be stored.

Output sections:
- Reasoning (3–5 bullets): selection criteria and vault alignment.
- Modes Overview: one-liners for each mode (Story Strategist, Worldbuilder, Character Architect, Prose Drafter, Line Editor, Style Coach, Continuity Keeper, Sensitivity Advisor, Obsidian Specialist, Prompt Refiner, Beta Reader).
- Shared Workflow: clarify → reasoning → deliverable; canon/safety; Obsidian hygiene.
- Output Format: Markdown-first; optional JSON (id, title, description, pov, location, date, dependencies, tags, links).
- Suggested file path: `.github/instructions/fantasy-creative-writing-studio.instructions.md`.

Keep it brief, mode-driven, and Obsidian-friendly.
