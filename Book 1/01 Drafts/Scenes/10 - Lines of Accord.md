Jarik Windmere adjusted the sea-tithe knot at his belt and reminded himself to move like a merchant, not a spy. The weight of the copper-cored ring on his finger felt heavier than it should—a tangible reminder that King Alistair Dawnspear's authority reached even here, to the storm-lashed docks of a foreign harbor where failure meant more than professional embarrassment.

"Your crates passed inspection," the harbormaster said, tucking the scroll case into his coat with the practiced efficiency of a man who processed fifty such documents each day. "Medicinal salts, Kandaran wool, and Brightshore timber. Standard merchant manifest. Your docking fee covers three days; renewal available at the harbor office."

"My thanks," Jarik replied, letting his accent carry just enough of Kandar's coastal cadence to mark him as foreign without sounding exotic. "Is there a guild representative available? I'm hoping to establish purchasing agreements for next season's trade."

The harbormaster's eyes flicked to the knot at Jarik's belt—a practiced assessment that confirmed both legitimacy and value. "Dockmaster Orin handles the larger arrangements. You'll find him at the Sailors' Rest after sunset. Mention the blue cog and he'll know you're serious money."

Jarik nodded his thanks and watched the harbormaster walk toward the harbor office with official purpose. The first layer of his cover was now documented and defensible; anyone checking the manifest would find a Kandaran trader with legitimate business and proper credentials. It wouldn't survive deep scrutiny, but it would deflect casual attention.

He turned to survey the harbor, letting his gaze sweep across the pier approaches with the kind of professional interest a merchant might show when assessing local infrastructure. His attention caught on two figures in brown who stood too still beside a stack of barrel hoops, their positioning perfect for observation while maintaining plausible deniability.

*Serathis,* he thought, recognizing the tradecraft even if he couldn't identify the individuals. *Already in position. Either they followed me here or they've been watching the harbor for days.*

Neither option was particularly encouraging.

"Problems?" asked Torven, the local contact who'd approached him near the warehouse. The man wore dock worker's canvas with the casual authority of someone who belonged here, but his eyes carried intelligence that marked him as more than hired muscle.

"Observers," Jarik said quietly. "Fourth pier, brown clothing. Professional spacing, clean sight lines. They're not dock workers."

Torven's expression didn't change, but his posture shifted almost imperceptibly toward alertness. "Eastern agents, you think?"

"Or local hire with eastern coin. Either way, we proceed carefully." Jarik began walking toward the pier's end, maintaining the unhurried pace of a man conducting ordinary business. "Status of the primary objective?"

"Confirmed," Torven said. "The Book is beneath Winter University, just as our intelligence suggested. But retrieval isn't feasible without inside cooperation. The wards are too complex and too well-maintained for external assault."

"Hence the diplomatic approach," Jarik murmured. He paused to examine a coil of rope with apparent merchant interest while actually checking the positions of the Serathis agents. They'd moved—one drifting toward the harbor office, the other angling toward his own position. Coordinated but not aggressive. Yet.

"Local political situation?" he asked.

"Fluid," Torven replied. "The University operates with significant autonomy, but city leadership is fragmented following the Coldreach siege. Eastern pressure is increasing, but there's resistance. A Professor Lareth Lakhart has been named High Mage—he's charismatic, and notably resistant to outside influence."

"First gate?"

"Administrator Vera Thricebind," Torven said without hesitation. "High Mage Lareth Lakhart sets arcane policy, Professor Melf Maelstorm controls volatile procurement, and Samantha Seraphel runs after-hours requisitions and the runners who make them happen. They operate as an inner circle—but nothing moves without Vera's signature." He waved at a passing dock worker, keeping his posture casual. "Approach the Administrator, and expect the other three to be in the room—formally or not."

Jarik processed this while watching a merchant vessel adjust its mooring. Three strong influencers orbiting a single decider changed the map: multiple motivations to account for, but one locus of authority to secure. Influence required nuance; assent required Vera.

"Recommendations?"

"Lakhart opens doors, Maelstorm holds veto on anything volatile, and Seraphel..." Torven's expression grew thoughtful. "Seraphel is new—junior but effective. She moves things after-hours and people listen because results arrive. Rising influence, not policy." He scratched at a splinter in the railing. "If you need a softer door, try Professor Hendricks—Natural Philosophy. Old merchant liaison. He can vouch you in without spooking the halls."

"Approach vector?"

"Mutual benefit. Kandar offers protection against Serathis expansion in exchange for academic cooperation. Stress shared interests, minimize territorial implications. These people value their independence above almost everything else."

The Serathis agent approaching from the warehouse was closing distance with professional patience. Not an immediate threat, but definitely gathering intelligence. Jarik made a mental note of her position and continued the conversation.

"Timeline constraints?"

"Unknown, but urgent," Torven said. "Our intelligence indicates Serathis is preparing something significant—possibly an occupation attempt following the Administrator's death. If they move first and secure the Book..."

"The Paladin King's instructions become irrelevant," Jarik finished. King Alistair had been clear: secure Kandaran access to the Sword of Gosh by any means necessary, including cooperation with local authorities. But cooperation required there being local authorities left to cooperate with.

"Initial contact protocol?"

"Tonight, if possible. Dockmaster Orin has been approached about arranging a discrete meeting. The University people are cautious but not opposed to dialogue." Torven paused as a cart loaded with grain sacks rumbled past. "They're also intelligent enough to recognize that Kandar's interests might align with their own."

"Verification requirements?"

"They'll test our credentials—the knot, the ring, probably a coin examination. Standard diplomatic protocol. They're being careful, which suggests they're taking this seriously."

Jarik felt the familiar tension of a mission entering its critical phase. Weeks of preparation, days of travel, hours of positioning—all building toward conversations that would determine whether King Alistair's gambit succeeded or failed. The Book of Gosh represented more than academic curiosity; it was the key to locating and potentially controlling the Sword of Gosh, the relic that could shift the balance of power across three kingdoms.

"Contingencies if contact fails?"

"Extract immediately," Torven said. "The harbor master's authority extends exactly as far as the dock tax receipts. Beyond that, you're on University ground or city territory, and both have become considerably less friendly to foreigners since Coldreach fell."

"And if Serathis moves first?"

Torven's smile was thin and professional. "Then we improvise. The Paladin King didn't send his best negotiator to Winterholme because he expected the mission to be simple."

The Serathis agent had positioned herself near a fish vendor's stall, close enough to observe while maintaining the pretense of commercial interest. Her partner had entered the harbor office, presumably to investigate Jarik's documentation or attempt bribery for information.

"Signal arrangements?"

"Blue lamp in the Sailors' Rest window means contact established. Red lamp means abort. No lamp..." Torven let the sentence hang.

"Understood." Jarik checked the sun's position—perhaps two hours until full darkness. Enough time to establish his merchant presence more thoroughly, but not enough to waste on elaborate preparations. "I'll need civilian clothes and a plausible reason to visit the University district."

"Already arranged. Academic supply merchant with a standing contract for alchemical components. Gives you legitimate reason to approach the Green Crucible, where Seraphel works."

"Excellent." Jarik began walking toward the shore, maintaining his merchant's assessment of local infrastructure while actually planning approach routes and escape vectors. Behind him, the Serathis agents maintained their surveillance with professional competence.

The game was beginning in earnest. Three kingdoms, three factions, and one Book that represented the key to power none of them could afford to lose.

Two hours later, Jarik stood before the iron gates of Winter University, transformed from merchant to academic supplier. His new clothes carried the practical quality of someone who dealt with dangerous materials—leather reinforced at joints, pockets designed for sample vials, the kind of measured caution that alchemists appreciated in their vendors. The transformation felt natural; he'd played similar roles in a dozen different cities.

The University perched above Winterholme like a guardian fortress, its towers carved from the same dark stone as the fjord cliffs. Ward-lights glittered along the walls in complex patterns that spoke to defensive preparations far beyond civilian requirements. Even from the approach road, Jarik could sense the layered enchantments that protected the institution—not just against casual intrusion, but against coordinated magical assault.

*Impressive,* he thought, cataloging the defensive measures with professional appreciation. *But also revealing. Universities don't maintain military-grade wards without expecting military-grade threats.*

"State your business," said the gate warden, a woman whose blue sash marked her as University staff rather than city guard. Her assessment was thorough but efficient—someone trained to distinguish between legitimate visitors and potential threats without causing unnecessary delays.

"Academic supplies," Jarik replied, producing documentation that Torven had provided. "Kandaran alchemical components for the Green Crucible. I have a standing contract with Professor Maelstorm's department."

The warden examined his credentials with practiced competence. "Redline Three protocols are in effect. External suppliers require escort and limited access." She gestured toward a younger man in similar blue livery. "Marcus will guide you to the procurement office."

As they walked through the University grounds, Jarik found himself impressed by the institution's organization despite its crisis footing. Students moved with purpose rather than panic, faculty maintained classroom schedules while clearly adapting to emergency protocols, and the overall atmosphere suggested an institution that had prepared for exactly this kind of coordinated pressure.

"Busy term," Jarik observed to his escort, letting his merchant persona show appropriate curiosity about conditions that might affect his business relationships.

"Siege preparations," Marcus replied with the casual competence of someone who'd grown accustomed to crisis operations. "Coldreach refugees, supply rationing, faculty on city defense rotations. The Administrator keeps things running smooth, though."

"The Administrator?"

"Vera Thricebind. Half-orc lady who runs the whole operation. Been keeping this place functioning through worse than most cities see in a lifetime." Marcus's respect was evident. "She's the one you'll need approval from for any major supply arrangements. Procurement office handles routine orders, but anything significant goes through her desk."

Jarik filed this information with professional satisfaction. Intelligence had identified the trio—Lakhart, Maelstorm, and Seraphel—as key decision-makers, but Marcus's comments suggested the real authority rested with the Administrator. Approaching the wrong person could waste crucial time or create political complications that would undermine the entire diplomatic effort.

Marcus lowered his voice as they passed a notice board crowded with timetables. "If you end up in the Green Crucible, Professor Melf Maelstorm signs for anything volatile. Samantha Seraphel—new, sharp—runs the after-hours requisitions and the runners who make them happen. And if it's arcane policy, High Mage Lareth Lakhart blesses or buries it." He tapped the board where the names appeared in neat ink. "Professor Hendricks handles merchant liaisons when Maelstorm is under-kiln; he's a sensible door to knock. But none of them outrank the Administrator. If it touches wards or coin, you start and end with her."

Jarik tucked the names away—three points of influence orbiting a fixed center.

"Is she available for meetings with suppliers?"

"Depends on the business. She's particular about time efficiency, but she knows that good supply relationships keep the University functioning." Marcus paused at a intersection where patrol routes converged. "Word of advice—she doesn't appreciate courtesy for courtesy's sake. State your business clearly, demonstrate value, and respect her schedule. Try to charm her or waste her time, and you'll find yourself escorted off the grounds with remarkable speed."

They reached the administrative building as afternoon shadows began lengthening across the courtyard. The structure combined elegant architecture with practical fortification—wide windows for natural light, but positioned to avoid creating defensive vulnerabilities. Ward-stones hummed with protective energy that extended throughout the complex, creating interlocking fields of magical security.

"Procurement office is through there," Marcus said, indicating a door marked with administrative symbols. "But if you want to request a meeting with the Administrator, you'll need to go through her personal secretary. Third floor, corner office. Fair warning—she screens appointments carefully."

Jarik thanked his escort and took a moment to assess his options. The procurement office would establish his legitimate business presence and provide cover for gathering intelligence about University operations. But a direct meeting with Administrator Thricebind represented the real objective—establishing diplomatic contact with the actual decision-making authority.

The choice wasn't difficult. King Alistair hadn't sent him to Winterholme to conduct routine commercial negotiations.

He climbed to the third floor, noting security measures that increased with each level—additional ward-stones, more sophisticated detection enchantments, and access points that would funnel visitors through controllable checkpoints. The University clearly understood that institutional protection required layered defenses against multiple categories of threat.

A junior clerk intercepted him, eyes flicking to the sea-tithe knot at his belt and the copper-cored ring on his finger. "State your business, sir?"

"Trade delegation from Kandar," Jarik replied, letting his accent mark him as foreign but not threatening. "I request an audience with Chief Administrator Vera Thricebind regarding academic procurement and mutual security interests."

The clerk hesitated, then nodded. "Wait here." Jarik watched the clerk disappear through a set of heavy doors, noting the subtle warding sigils etched into the stone—evidence of Vera's reputation for layered defenses.

Minutes later, Jarik was ushered into Vera's office. The Administrator stood behind her desk, forearms scarred and posture unyielding. Her gaze was as precise as the ticking of her pocket watch.

"Your credentials are in order," Vera said, voice clipped. "But your timing is suspect. Winterholme is under threat, and I have little patience for opportunistic diplomacy."

Jarik inclined his head. "Kandar offers more than trade. We have intelligence on Serathis movements and wish to coordinate for mutual benefit. My king's instructions are clear: support Winterholme's autonomy, provided we have access to certain academic resources."

Vera's expression did not soften. "You mean the Book. You're not the first to ask, and you won't be the last. My priority is the safety of my students and the integrity of the University. Any negotiation will be on my terms."

Jarik weighed his next words carefully. "Kandar can offer protection—military, magical, and diplomatic. But we require transparency. Serathis agents are already moving in the city. If Winterholme falls, the Book will be lost to all."

He placed a single folded note on the edge of her desk. "For verification—not leverage. Professor Hendricks can vouch my prior dealings with the University for natural philosophy components five winters ago. Routine, documented, satisfactory."

Vera's stillness was absolute. "Protection is not a gift. It is leverage. I will consider your proposal, but understand this: the University is not a pawn. If you wish to help, you will do so under my protocols. Any deviation, and you will find yourself outside these walls."

Jarik nodded, recognizing the boundaries. "Agreed. My king values strong partners, not subordinates."

Vera turned to a ward journal, making a note. "You will submit your intelligence to my office. In return, I will allow limited access to our archives—under supervision. Any attempt to circumvent my authority will be met with force."

Jarik accepted the terms, knowing that the real negotiation had only just begun. As he left Vera's office, he understood that the fate of Kandar's mission—and perhaps Winterholme itself—rested on the Administrator's granite patience and the fragile trust he'd begun to build.

He paused in the corridor outside her office, letting the door's click fade into the thrumming ward-hum that pressed faintly against his teeth. The administrative wing ran like a warship: aides moving in purposeful patterns, messengers exchanging slates, the occasional faculty member slipping through with the distracted intensity of someone who knew exactly how much time a problem might permit before it became a crisis. It told him something important—Vera did not simply command; she orchestrated.

Jarik recorded the encounter in cipher on a narrow page he could palm if searched: Thricebind—direct; values process over platitude; accepts cooperation under her command; non-negotiables: student safety, institutional autonomy, chain-of-custody for knowledge. He added a mark beside the last line and underlined it twice. In places like this, knowledge was the coin and the battlefield.

On his way out, the secretary who had screened him earlier caught his eye. "If your 'mutual security interests' translate to unsupervised armed men inside my courtyards, you'll find the gates less welcoming tomorrow."

"Understood," he said. "Our liaisons will wear your colors when inside your walls and take orders from your officers. Written, countersigned."

The secretary's mouth twitched—the closest thing to approval he expected today. "Submit the names before midnight. Procurement closes at ninth bell, but my desk does not."

By the time he crossed the outer quadrangle, night had laid a cold sheen across the stone. Behind him, the University breathed—order riding on the back of strain. Ahead, Winterholme's lamps guttered in the wind that came down the fjord like a warning. He adjusted his pace to suit a supplier leaving late, neither furtive nor leisurely, and planned the relay: first to the Sailors' Rest to raise the blue lamp for Torven, then to the Lantern House back room for the University's reply, then—if fortune held—back through the same doors under new terms.

Notes: This consolidated Scene 10 merges the harbor cover (10B Emissary POV) with the University audience. 10B remains preserved in `Scenes/10 - Lines of Accord/10B - Emissary POV.md`. Focus remains on Administrator Vera as principal authority; Jarik’s approach is diplomatic under University protocols.
