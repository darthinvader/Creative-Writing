**Predecessor:** [[Gorran Thricebind]] (deceased High Mage)  

## Overview

The unnamed Administrator serves as the institutional backbone of [[Winter University]], wielding practical authority over resources, personnel, and crisis management. Her half-orc heritage and scarred forearms speak to both physical capability and hands-on experience with dangerous magical work. She operates with granite-like efficiency, treating time as a limited resource and making decisions based on evidence rather than sentiment.

- **Tools:** Pocket watch for precise time management; precise handwriting in ledgers
