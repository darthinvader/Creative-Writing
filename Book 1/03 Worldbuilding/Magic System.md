# Magic System — The Lattice

Summary: Magic flows through a pervasive substrate called [[#The Lattice]] (renamed from “weave”). Using the Lattice has simple, story-first costs: fatigue for casters, focus drain, and wear on tools/wards. Different traditions (arcane, divine, alchemical) couple to the Lattice with different rhythms and risks.

## The Lattice
- Definition: An all-pervasive, patterned substrate of potentials and vectors through which phenomena can be gently urged or violently compelled.
- Properties: Structured like braided currents; responsive to pattern, intent, timing; elastic but not infinite.
- Access:
  - Arcane: Patterned thought, sigils, runes, and trained focus create coupling.
  - Divine: Vowed concord with a power/story grants mediated access; covenant acts as a stabilizer.
  - Alchemical: Materials and reactions pre-bind effects; the Lattice is engaged through matter and process.
- Continuity: Use “The Lattice” everywhere; avoid the D&D term.

## Costs & Limits (plain)
- Fatigue: Magic tires the caster; breath shortens, focus wavers.
- Focus: Complex patterns demand attention; slipping focus blurs sigils and intent.
- Tools: Staves, circles, and wards wear and foul; they need cleaning, binder washes, and occasional re-scribing.
- Misuse Risks: Overreach leads to misfires/backlash; fouling (salts/iron grit) makes precise work skate until cleaned.
- Management: Rest, rotate casters, keep patterns short and tight under pressure, maintain tools, work in teams.

## Traditions (how they pay)
- Arcane
  - Direct coupling; precise but heat-intensive at high output.
  - Tools: circles, staves, tuned foci, measured cadence. Overheating risks burn-through (spell blows past constraints) or sputter (fails dirty).
- Divine (Samantha)
  - The vow creates a stabilized channel. Costs land chiefly as exertion and clarity; she tires before she wavers.
  - Costs: Spiritual and physical exertion; extended overreach risks “Concord Fracture” (loss of clarity, not loss of faith) and exhaustion. Her faith is nearly unshakable; failure manifests as depletion, not doubt.
  - Advantages: Cleaner edges under pressure; smites can be “measured” with minimal collateral.
- Alchemical
  - Costs expressed as temperature/pressure; managed with coils, baths, and timing. Fouling (e.g., alchemical chaff) disrupts fine couplings; countered by binder washes and revised chalk.

## Lattice Sight (Lareth’s unique sense)
- Capability: Lareth can perceive Lattice flows directly—threads, tension, phase. He reads where patterns will hold cleanly and where they’ll skate or bite back.
- Uses: 
  - Tactical: Choose minimum-force lines; stitch fire where it pins, not flares.
  - Safety: Keep teams under Redline; catch imminent misfires.
  - Craft: Tune wards, timing, and interlocks with surgical precision.
- Limits: Chaos and heavy working create glare; prolonged use is fatiguing (eye-strain-of-the-soul). He trains cadence and restraint.

## Institutional Protocols (Winter University)
- Redline Levels: Operational posture in labs/field. Redline Three = crisis mode; external petitions paused; faculty oversight; resource triage.
- Practice: Keep work in short, tight patterns; rotate casters; maintain circles and tools; conceal large effects to avoid enemy “clocking.”
- Green Crucible: Lab hall with coils, sinks, and binder stations for anti-fouling and countermeasure work.

## Edge Cases & Risks
- Warp Pockets: Overused spaces become “sticky”—runes skate, candles gutter oddly.
- Fouling: Salts/iron grit (chaff) add noise; tight, short chalk marks and binder washes restore bite.
- Overdraw: Arcane—burn-through; Divine—concord fatigue; Alchemical—overpressure.

## Simple Contracts (table cues)
-## Steady Voice & Control (practice cues)
- Voice carries pattern: Clear, steady intonation and breath support anchor complex workings; a shaken voice blurs lines.
- Hands teach the line: Small, precise gestures and short, tight sigils keep edges clean under pressure.
- Lareth vs. Melf (casting profiles):
  - Lareth — high capacity and battlefield control; excels at holding large effects steady and choosing minimum‑force lines.
  - Melf — lower baseline capacity but superior precision; excels at fine materials magic and surgical fixes under pressure.
- Blood Magic (Melf, rare): Temporarily multiplies Melf’s capacity and unlocks a deeper repertoire of powerful spells; costs are severe (fatigue, risk of overreach, ethical toll). Used only when other options are exhausted.
- Success: Effect within intended bounds; caster steady; tools cool quickly.
- Near-limit: Effect works; edges fray; brief rest/rotation advised.
- Breach: Misfire/backlash/warp; stop and reset; clean and re‑scribe.

## Continuity Notes
- Replace all uses of “weave” with “The Lattice.”
- Avoid meters and jargon in prose; show fatigue, focus, and tool care.
- Tie Samantha’s resilience to vow-stability, not naïveté; her faith does not wobble under strain.

## Hooks
- Training scenes: Cadence drills; sight-adjacent heuristics for students.
- Plot tech: Counter-fouling binder wash rollout; enemy “clocking” tricks.
- Character: Samantha pushes to Concord’s edge to protect innocents; Lareth risks glare during a major strike.
