Jarik had expected negotiations to be formal and slow—ink-laden petitions, careful phrases, and the inevitable requests for references. He had not expected the University to move with the fleet-footed efficiency of a war council.

The Lantern House back room smelled of old oil and hot tea. Low benches circled a single iron brazier, and the Kandaran emissary sat across from a curt, unadorned woman who introduced herself as Vera Thricebind's secretary. Their conversation started with procurement lists and the kind of courteous minutiae that eased the harbormaster's mind, but a single phrase—"mutual security interests"—changed the room's temperature.

She tested him without making it look like a test. The sea-tithe knot? Authentic, with a fisherman’s thumbwear. The copper-cored ring? Stamped on the inner band where only a true bearer would know to look. The coin? She rolled it between two fingers, listening for the faint shift of weight that marked Kandaran mintwork. Then came the questions that mattered: How many men can you put to a wall without a captain? How do your wardmages mark a false anchor? Who in Winterholme can vouch for you by name?

"Dockmaster Orin," he said. "And Torven of the harbor. They will vouch that I am who I say I am, and that I pay on time."

"We accept intelligence, not bargains made behind curtains," the secretary said, voice even. "The Administrator will hear your claims, but she decides what to act on. Do you understand that a promise of protection requires documented value?"

"My king's intelligence is specific and verified by coastal watch reports," Jarik said, sliding a folded vellum across the table. The secretary examined it with quick, practiced hands: knot descriptions, ship manifests, names. A small punctuation mark he had not intended to include—the name "Dawnspear"—sat like an exposed nerve.

The secretary's eyes flicked toward the window where a faint lamp in the University's tower cast a steady glow. She made a note, then rose. "Wait here. You will be escorted to the Administrator. Fifteen minutes."

The escort through the University was efficient and silent, as if the corridors themselves preferred not to be noticed. Jarik's merchant persona shifted into diplomat-mode—face composed, words measured—but he cataloged everything. Students in borrowed cloaks moved with purpose; faculty bore tired lines around their mouths. Ward-lights were dimmed to readiness rather than to save fuel. The University felt older than its stones suggested, a place with ingrained ritual and emergency rhythms.

Vera received him again, and the conversation resumed where it had left off: terms, oversight, and a demand that intelligence be submitted in a form that would not compromise campus safety.

"Why is Kandar involved?" Vera asked finally, gaze steady.

"Because instability on the trade routes endangers the West as much as the East," Jarik said. "We have forces and channels that can blunt Serathis merchant expansion—if given proper coordination and oversight." He kept his voice low. "But we do not act without evidence, and we require certain academic resources to verify and interpret localized ward signatures."

Vera's jaw eased a fraction. "You ask for access to arcane records. You understand that those records are restricted for good reason. They contain maps and ward patterns that, in the wrong hands, would make Winterholme untenable."

"We understand the risk," Jarik replied. "Kandar's purpose is not seizure but prevention. If you allow supervised study, we will place liaison officers under your command and submit to University vetting." He allowed a quiet confidence to settle into his voice—what it lacked in command it made up for in the implied reach of his king's resources.

Vera slid a single-page form across the desk. "Names, disciplines, rank, and the precise scope of authority they believe they possess. I will revoke any scope that overlaps with mine."

Vera paused, thumb worrying the crystal ring at her desk. "You provide verifiable intelligence and submit to our supervision. We grant supervised access to specific procurement ledgers and ward-journals. You will not move on any artifact without a University escort. Any breach, and you leave Winterholme. Any leak traced to your people, and you will not re-enter this city while I draw breath." Her terms were blunt and institutional.

"Accepted," Jarik said, and knew he had accepted the cost as much as the access.

As he left Vera's office, the night outside felt both colder and sharper. The University had given him terms; the next move belonged to those within the stone circle—the trio who had convinced the Administrator to listen in the first place.

He had hoped for discussion among the University leadership—calm, rational calculations with margins for political reality. Instead, the trio moved quickly: Lareth convened a small strategy board in the Green Crucible; Melf drafted contingency enchantments; Samantha moved among students and junior faculty gathering volunteers and relevant reagents.

The Green Crucible was a low, simmering room that smelled of vinegar and heated copper. Rune-kilns hummed, and students shifted palettes of powdered reagents like chess pieces. Lareth drew precise arcs in the dust, mapping likely Serathis approaches and probable Tengus contingencies. His lattice sight, Jarik noted with professional interest, revealed corridors of power the ordinary eye missed—ward lines, anchor nodes, vulnerabilities.

Lareth split the room into teams with the ease of someone who had learned to turn fear into function:
- Anchor Team (Faculty-led): inspect and bolster ward anchors at the bell towers and the east library sub-basement; priority on redundancy.
- Corridor Team (Mixed): establish choke points with temporary wards that hinder without maiming; student-heavy to maximize familiarity with halls.
- Evac Team (Student-led): memorize and maintain three evacuation paths per dormitory level; pair each path with a decoy cache.
- Liaison Team (External): coordinate with Jarik's officers; wear University blue sashes when on campus; carry letters countersigned by Vera.

Melf worked at a side bench, hands stained with juniper and binder wash, but his mind was elsewhere—stone-sense widened to the University's foundation. He tapped a leather folio and said, "Containment first. If Kandar moves too fast and we don't control the access points, they hand us a problem wrapped in coin."

He laid out a short list with a teacher's brisk clarity: three portable lattice wards from the east kiln; six ward-pins keyed to Vera's signature; two breaker coils for controlled fails; and, almost as an afterthought, a bucket of sand for the inevitable fire that wasn't magical at all. "Heroics burn archives," he said, "but sand saves them."

Samantha moved through the crucible like a quiet commander, speaking to apprentices with a sense of authority that belonged to someone who'd earned it through action rather than rank. "We will not trade the Book or its location," she said plainly. "We defend, and we verify. If Kandar helps, they help under our guard. If they do not, they stay at the borders where they can be watched." Her eyes met Jarik's for a moment—neither plea nor threat, simply an assessing look that cataloged the man in small, efficient details.

She assigned recruiters by corridor, pairing the calm with the quick. "We need runners who can carry a message without becoming part of it," she told a tall apprentice with ink-stained fingers. To another: "Find alumni with private wards. Ask for cached blankets and lantern oil, not promises." To a third: "Tell Tiana we need eyes on the trade district gates. Quiet eyes."

"And if Serathis pushes now?" Jarik asked. The question was less hypothetical than urgent.

Lareth did not look up from his mapping. "Then we stall until we can seal or move what needs moving. We do not give them an excuse to occupy." He set a charcoal mark on the map where the harbor met the trade district. "We use the bastions, and we present a united front that makes occupation politically costly for Serathis." His tone carried no illusions: politics would decide whether ships carried gold or soldiers.

Melf tapped his folio. "And if politics fails us? Then we fight in a way that preserves students. Evacuation routes, decoy caches, warded storerooms that can burn but protect knowledge. The stones remember; we can buy time by changing what the stones trust."

Samantha added quietly, "We will ask for help from those who owe the University favors—guilds, alumni with private wards, and student networks like Tiana's. Not all help looks like soldiers. Some will be places to hide, some will be messengers, and some will be people who know how to unstick a locked gate without breaking it." She looked at Jarik. "If you mean to help, know that the University measures help by the safety it creates, not by the coin it offers." 

Jarik understood. Kandar's offer of protection was not a blank check; it was a resource that required institutional stewardship. He offered liaison names and a roster of available specialists: engineers who could shore walls, wardmages to reinforce anchors under guidance, and a small detachment of royal marines trained to avoid civilian harm. Each offer came with the implicit requirement that the University remain in command.

"We will accept aid on those terms," Lareth said, voice clipped. "But we will also run background checks on everyone you place here. Our students will not become bargaining chips."

Jarik offered three names and wrote them where Samantha could see: Captain Ivar Noll (marines), Engineer Sera Vance (bulwarks), Adept Kellan Rhee (wards). "All three accept local command while on University ground," he said. "All three will submit to interview tonight."

A junior apprentice stepped forward, cheeks flushed from work. "Professor Melf, I can spare two wards from the east kiln. They'll hold for three days if reinforced." He was young, hair singed at the tips; his resolve was older than his years.

Melf smiled, hand ruffling the boy's hair with a gentleness that contrasted with his public bluster. "Good. Wrap them well. We will teach the reinforcement pattern to three others."

Samantha gathered lists—names, skills, availability—scribbling with focused speed. "We can't rely on outsiders alone," she said. "We must galvanize what we have here. Students and faculty who know these halls can move secrets faster than any fleet."

The plan that night was not cinematic; it was granular and practical. Evacuation nodes, ward-repair teams, liaison protocols, and public narratives to dissuade occupation. Jarik watched as the University turned triage into strategy with practiced, humane efficiency. Even the words carried weight—"contain," not "conquer"; "protect," not "project."

When the meeting broke, Jarik left with a sense of cautious optimism. He had gained supervised access and an agreement for limited aid. He also knew where the University's red lines lay. If Kandar respected them, a quiet partnership might form. If Kandar pushed, the University would resist.

Outside, the harbor's lamps threw orange pools across black water. The city breathed and waited, every mast a distant sentinel. Jarik wrapped his cloak and made his way back to the Sailors' Rest with plans to file the required intelligence and name the liaisons he had promised. Above him, the University tower-lights held steady, a deliberate signal to anyone watching that order still had a place to stand.

The night held its breath; parties in motion had aligned only for the briefest of turns. The next few days would show whether the accord would hold or snap under pressure.
