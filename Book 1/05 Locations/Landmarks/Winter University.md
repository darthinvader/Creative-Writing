# Winter University

- Summary: Codaria’s arcane and scholarly center; perched above a fjord with wind-carved spires and geothermal halls.
- Reputation: Practical magic; graduates serve harbors, mines, and councils.

## Faculties & Disciplines
- Transmutation College — chaired by [[Melf Maelstorm]]; materials science, structural wards.
- Evocation & War Arts — senior faculty includes [[Lareth Lakhart]]; siegecraft ethics, counter-battery.
## Faculty & Notables
- Chief Administrator: Half-Orc (name TBD) — oversees crisis protocols and student safety
- Treasurer: Jady (druid) — manages funding and resource allocation; favors sustainable provisioning
 - High Mage: Gorran Thricebind (Half-Orc, Abjuration) — dies early in Book 1 during the Codaria crisis
 - Succession: [[Lareth Lakhart]] elected High Mage in wartime to lead defense and strategy
- Ritual Studies — warding, contract magic, hearth sigils.
- Applied Leycraft — mapping and maintenance of basaltic leylines.

## Culture
- Motto: “Hold Fast, Work True.”
- Pranks: Encouraged when instructive and harmless. Lewdness discouraged by code of conduct.

## Security & Protocols
- City defense accord with councils—faculty may be seconded during crises.
- Redline Rules: Blood magic must be declared and supervised; exceptions permitted only under imminent threat with triad oversight.
 - Safety & Cadence Protocols:
	 - Keep patterns short and tight under pressure. Favor stitch-lines over grand waves when precision matters.
	 - Rotate casters during long work; rest hands and minds before precision tasks.
	 - Maintain tools: clean fouling (salts/iron grit) with binder wash; re‑scribe circles when edges blur.
	 - Conceal high-output work where possible to avoid enemy “clocking” of our capabilities.
	 - Redline Three (crisis posture): external petitions paused; triage of people and materials; faculty oversight on all casting and lab work.
	 - If we don’t want Heat: Treat magic as costless for the scene. Remove clocking/needle mentions; keep only character fatigue as flavor. This is a dial, not a cage.

## Timeline
- Y1 M1 D1 — Organized retreat from [[Coldreach]] begins; civilians and students received under emergency shelter protocols. See [[01 - Siege at Coldreach]] and [[Timeline]].
