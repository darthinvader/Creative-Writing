# 30 — The Gate at Winter

Goal: Stop Baramoth’s full manifestation at the University.
Conflict: Tengus springs the pact; minotaur demons breach.
Turn: Samantha enacts the counter-rite; Melf unleashes necessary blood magic.
Outcome: Baramoth is stopped; explosion imminent; Gosh shields many; Lareth sacrifices himself to protect students; Samantha kills Tengus; Melfina and Karol-Elf assist decisively.

Notes: Keep on-page action focused on choice, cost, and protection; set up aftermath stakes.
