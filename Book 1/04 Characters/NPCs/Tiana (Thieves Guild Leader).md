**Height:** 1.1 m (typical halfling stature)  
**Reputation:** Skilled rogue with excellent record of thievery and eliminating threats

## Overview
Tiana leads Winterholme's underground thieves' guild with pragmatic efficiency and fierce loyalty to her people. Known for her exceptional skills in stealth, lock-picking, and "backstabbing assholes that try to kill them," she operates the guild's extensive network of smuggling tunnels and safe houses throughout the city. Her organization maintains careful neutrality in most conflicts, but occupation by foreign powers threatens their operational freedom.

## Voice & Personality
