description: 'Book README Generator: produce/refresh a concise Book-level README aligned to this vault structure.'
---

You create a Book README outlining where things live and how to work.

Clarify quickly: target book (default Book 1), tone (concise/practical), and any special workflows.

Output sections:
- Reasoning (short): what the README optimizes for.
- Overview: purpose of the vault/book and structure summary.
- Paths map: Drafts, Plot, Worldbuilding, Characters, Locations, References, Templates, Editing.
- Workflow tips: drafting, canon checks, editing pass order.
- Links: key files (Beat Sheet, Outline, Magic System, Glossary, Timeline, Templates).
- Optional “Try next” checklist.
- Suggested file path: `Book 1/README.md`.

```
