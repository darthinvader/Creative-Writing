# Samantha Seraphel

- Pronunciation: sah-MAN-tha SEH-rah-fell
- Height: 1.75 m
- Appearance: White human with golden blonde hair; reasonable build concealing great strength and muscle—deceptively powerful physique
- Occupation: Paladin-Emissary (Herald of Valamar)
- Faith: Valamar (Platinum Dragon)
- Family: Sister to Queen [[Andromeda]] of [[Whitehaven]]; daughter of deceased angels
- Affiliation: [[Codaria]] (visitor), allied with faculty at [[Winter University]]
- Goal: Find a great spellcaster to aid [[Erandia]] against a covert divine conflict (background; not a book-1 plotline).
- Motivation: Loyalty to her god, her sister, and the people of [[Erandia]]; a sense of duty and justice.
- Conflict: Her homeland is considered a myth; enemy god's agents (The Silence) sap magic from casters and undermine faith. Her true angelic nature remains hidden, even from herself.
- Stakes: If she fails, divine influence wanes and [[Erandia]] collapses into silence; her sister's kingdom falls to demonic forces.

## GMC (Goal • Motivation • Conflict)
- Goal: Recruit a master spellcaster capable of countering a grand ritual draining magic (background aim; Book 1 focuses on Codaria's crisis).
- Motivation: Duty as a Herald; compassion and order aligned with her god; protect innocents first.
- Conflict: Disbelief about [[Erandia]]'s existence; foreign interference; personal inexperience; latent angelic nature complicates signs and rites.

## Background & Heritage
- Born in [[Whitehaven]], the sacred northern kingdom of [[Erandia]]
- Daughter of angelic parents who have since passed away
- Younger sister to Queen [[Andromeda]], who rules [[Whitehaven]]
- Trained as both paladin and Herald in the traditions of [[Erandia]]
- Sent by her sister to seek allies against The Silence and demonic forces

## Wounds & Fears
- Wound: Exiled by circumstance—left her divine homeland when few believed her story.
- Fear: Being dismissed as a liar or zealot; losing the last link to her faith; failing her sister and [[Erandia]].
- Faith State: Nearly unshakable; under strain she suffers depletion, not doubt (risk: Concord Fracture = temporary clarity loss, remedied by rest/rite).

## Abilities
- Close‑quarters weapon mastery: disciplined strikes, joint control, efficient disarms; trained in precise, economy-of-motion combat.
- Empowered Smite: focused divine strike ("Valamar") that adds controlled force to a blow; used sparingly and precisely with measured restraint.
- Ward maintenance: can identify fouled magical staves and perform basic counter-marking to restore function.
- Paladin rites (oaths, warding steadies, protective auras); Herald authority in sacred spaces.
- Concord Channel: her covenant stabilizes coupling to [[Magic System — The Lattice|The Lattice]]; costs as exertion and clarity—she tires, but her edge stays clean.
- Keen intuition for divine‑magic anomalies; unconscious angelic resilience.
- Lattice sensitivity: her divine covenant makes her sensitive to magical flows and patterns, though she lacks the scholarly terms to name what she perceives.
- Herald training: diplomatic protocols, cultural research, and preparation for formal petitions; "a Herald comes prepared."
- Polite diplomacy with stubborn persistence.
- Angelic heritage (dormant): Enhanced physical capabilities, resistance to corruption, sensitivity to divine magic—mostly unconscious.

## Relationships
- Sister: Queen [[Andromeda]] of [[Whitehaven]] ([[Erandia]]), distant but formative.
- Emerging allies: [[Melf Maelstorm]], [[Lareth Lakhart]] — earned their respect through competent action during the Coldreach siege.
- Respectful toward scholars at [[Winter University]].
- Connection to [[Whitehaven]]'s paladin orders and religious community.

## Arc Notes
- Act I: Outsider seeking legitimacy; learns to frame truth for skeptical audiences.
- Act II: Proves Codaria's threat is real; catalyzes cooperation between rival disciplines.
- Act III: Chooses protection of the present over distant crusade; hints of true angelic nature surface.

## Voice Cues
- Earnest, precise, respectful; observes before asserting.
- Uses religious metaphors quietly; avoids proselytizing.
- Moves with disciplined economy; awareness sharpened by training.
- References [[Erandia]] with homesick fondness but diplomatic restraint.

## Continuity Notes
- Her angelic heritage remains hidden from herself and others
- Temple bells in [[Erandia]] create supernatural harmonics that she misses
- Formal diplomatic protocols learned in [[Whitehaven]]
- Cultural emphasis on preparation and service from Herald training
- Relationship with Queen [[Andromeda]] shaped by duty and family bonds
