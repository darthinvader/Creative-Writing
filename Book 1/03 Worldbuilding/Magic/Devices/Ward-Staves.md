# Ward-Staves

## Description
Ward-staves are wooden defensive magical devices placed at strategic intervals along fortifications. They provide protective magical fields but require regular maintenance and are vulnerable to magical interference.

## Physical Characteristics
- **Material**: Wood (specific type not specified)
- **Size**: Appear to be staff-sized, suitable for mounting on walls
- **Markings**: Feature spiral patterns and chalk marks for magical focusing
- **Placement**: Set at intervals along fortification walls

## Function and Operation
### Normal Operation
- Emit steady, warm light indicating active protective field
- Provide continuous magical defense when functioning properly
- Require occasional maintenance and recalibration

### Magical Components
- **Spiral Pattern**: Core focusing element carved or inscribed into the wood
- **Chalk Marks**: Counter-marks and adjustment symbols for fine-tuning
- **Energy Source**: Draw from ambient magical fields or stored power

## Maintenance Requirements
### Cleaning and Calibration
- Require regular cleaning with oiled wool to remove contaminants
- Chalk marks must be refreshed with "tightening curves" for adjustment
- Need periodic blessing or recharging with minor magical rites

### Signs of Malfunction
- **Dimming Light**: Indicates power loss or fouling
- **Color Change**: Healthy white light becoming sickly yellow suggests corruption
- **Complete Failure**: Total loss of light indicates critical malfunction

## Vulnerabilities
### Alchemical Interference ([[01 - Siege at Coldreach]])
- **Alchemical Chaff**: Salted ash and iron particles foul the magical channels
- **Grit Contamination**: Foreign substances disrupt the delicate magical balance
- **Counter-Marks**: Enemy sabotage through deliberate marking or defacement

### Environmental Factors
- Cold and ice can affect operation
- Physical damage to the wood compromises function
- Exposure to conflicting magical energies

## Repair and Restoration
### Field Maintenance
1. **Assessment**: Check for light quality and energy flow
2. **Cleaning**: Remove contaminants with appropriate materials
3. **Recalibration**: Add corrective chalk marks at specific points
4. **Blessing**: Apply minor magical rites to restore function

### Emergency Protocols
- Quick cleaning with oiled wool during combat
- Temporary chalk adjustments for immediate restoration
- Priority repair sequence during siege conditions

## Strategic Importance
- **Defensive Perimeters**: Form crucial part of city defenses
- **Resource Management**: Relatively low-cost magical protection
- **Scalability**: Can be deployed along extensive fortifications
- **Reliability**: Generally dependable when properly maintained

## Operational Context
### During Siege Warfare
- Become primary targets for enemy magical interference
- Require dedicated personnel for maintenance under fire
- Critical for maintaining defensive magical fields
- Vulnerable to targeted alchemical attacks

## Related Technologies

- [[Glyph-Arches]] (architectural magical systems)
- [[Alchemical Chaff]] (counter-measure technology)

## First Appearance
Scene: [[01 - Siege at Coldreach]]
Context: Fortification defense, requiring emergency maintenance during enemy assault with alchemical countermeasures.
