# Repository Custom Instructions for GitHub Copilot

- This repo is an Obsidian-based creative writing vault for fantasy novels. Prefer Markdown outputs, no code.
- Respect the vault structure under `Book 1/` (Drafts, Plot, Worldbuilding, Characters, Locations, References, Templates).
- Map generated artifacts to the correct folders and suggest a file path.
- Use concise reasoning (3–7 bullets) before deliverables; keep outputs skimmable.
- Follow Obsidian hygiene: use wikilinks [[Like This]] for internal references; minimal YAML frontmatter per `Book 1/07 Templates/Frontmatter Fields.md`.
- Avoid harmful content; offer respectful alternatives.
- For writing, set POV, tense, target wordcount, and an emotional turn; prefer scene-level chunks.
- When in doubt, propose 2–3 options and ask one short confirmation question.
- Reuse the studio modes and prompts in `.github/chatmodes` and `.github/prompts`.
