# 02 — Petition in the Winter Garden

## Purpose
- Conflict/Goal: Samantha insists on accompanying [[Lareth Lakhart]] and [[Melf Maelstorm]] to plead her case for spellcasters to aid her cause.
- Stakes: University resources are stretched by siege; her credibility is fragile.
- Outcome (lose): She is politely refused; redirected to present crisis.

## Beat Outline
- Opening image: Crossing the frost-bright cloister into the University’s garden—glasshouses breathing, beds labeled in tidy brass.
- Inciting moment: Samantha states she will speak for spellcasters before any council that will hear her.
- Rising complications: Faculty triage, students carrying crates of reagents; talk of depleted stocks and emergency protocols; a gate-warden challenges outsiders.
- Climax/turning point: In the herbarium cloister, an administrator declines her petition due to wartime rationing; policy cited.
- Resolution/hook: Melf promises a hearing later; Lareth offers a narrow task she can own now: help formulate anti-chaff wash in the Green Crucible; Samantha accepts.

## On-page Notes
- Sensory detail of the Winter Garden: steam in cold air; scents of crushed juniper, peat, vinegar, foxglove, brimstone; bees asleep in glass hives; rune‑kilns and alchemical braziers; runic irrigation.
- Keep Samantha’s voice precise, observant, respectful.

They came in with the bells still naming streets. The University took the sound and sorted it into work. Doors unlatched. Runners appeared like phrases in a familiar language—two with ledgers, one with a bell of his own. Snow smoked from cloaks as they crossed the outer cloister. 

Samantha had expected towers and lecture halls; she had not expected the garden.

Winter University’s garden opened like a held breath. Beds lay in ordered geometry under the pale sun, their paths edged in black basalt that drank what warmth there was. Glasshouses ran along the inner wall—long backs of ribbed glass that breathed a faint, even fog into the cold. Brass plaques named each bed in tidy script: winter aconite; saint’s valerian; juniper; foxglove; frost-mint. A row of copper glyph‑arches arced over a trough where water ran without freezing, sigils pulsing slow as heartbeats to keep the flow from seizing.

Steam met sleet and made ghost-clouds at ankle height. The air was an argument between scents: peat and vinegar from the tanners’ wash, sweet bay crushed underfoot, a whisper of brimstone from a sealed retort in the alchemical shed. Beyond the hedges, a glass hive slept with its bees clotted in amber clusters, the combs faintly luminous where a tiny rune kept them just above death’s drowse.

“This way,” Lareth said. The clipped cadence made a path as surely as his hand. He led them along a cinder path between beds where small black stakes bore chalk marks that would mean nothing to a layman and far too much to a student. Samantha watched them the way she watched people’s hands.

A gate-warden in a blue sash stepped from the arch. “Faculty and students only under Redline Three,” she said, breath smoking, voice professional rather than unkind. Her eyes took in Samantha’s satchel, the soot on her cuffs, the small cuts along her knuckles. “Visitors will be billeted in the east lecture hall.”

“She’s with us,” Melf said, not slowing. He nudged a brass lever with the back of his knuckles as he passed; somewhere a sluice opened with a soft chuck and water changed its mind about direction. “And I am about to break three separate procurement rules in the shed, but we’re calling it pedagogy.”

“Professor.” The warden’s mouth thought about smiling and decided against it. She stepped aside. “The Administrator is in the herbarium.”

“I will go where I must,” Samantha said to the warden, because politeness is cheaper than conflict, “but I came to speak. Not only of Coldreach.”

The warden’s gaze flicked to Lareth.

“She will speak,” Lareth said, which was a promise with edges. “We’ll keep it brief.”

They crossed under an arch cut with old wave-marks—the basalt had been sea once, long before anyone read it. In the herbarium cloister, glass panes turned the snow to light. Tables held trays of labeled cuttings; a blackboard bore a list of shortfalls in a hand with no flourishes: saltpeter low; copper wire low; glass alembics (thin); juniper cones (green only); alcohol (denatured) down to two casks; vinegar (sour) fine; foxglove leaves to be rationed to infirmary; brimstone safe; binder gum pending.

People moved like they had been told what mattered. A boy barely old enough to shave staggered under a crate of peat blocks; a woman with ink to her wrists counted glass pipettes into a rack with a rhythm like prayer. Melf’s students—Samantha guessed by the cut of their coats and the way their eyes tried to be everywhere—ran for the shed where a brazier sighed and a rune‑kiln steamed with intent.

The Administrator stood by the board, sleeves rolled, a half-orc with neat tusks and an expression that did not change to suit the room. “Professor. Marshal.” She nodded to Melf and Lareth in equal measure. Her gaze took in Samantha without curiosity and without disdain. “Report.”

“Alchemical chaff in the assault,” Lareth said. “Salted ash and iron. It fouls our delicate work—wards, catches, triggers. We need a binder wash and a chalk that sets through grit. Melf will lead formulation in the Green Crucible.”

“Green Crucible is live?” the Administrator asked.

“Two rune‑kilns and an attitude,” Melf said. “I’ll make them get along.”

“Good.” She chalked two lines under binder gum, then stood still long enough to be very clear that she could stand still while others rushed. Only then did she look to Samantha. “And you?”

“I am Samantha Seraphel,” she said, and did not add titles. She had tried that too often to anything but narrowing eyes. “I came to plead a case to the University’s spellcasters—those who would choose to hear me. My homeland needs aid.”

The Administrator listened the way a stone listens—fully, without yielding. “You will be billeted with the others. We will feed you and keep you warm. We are not accepting external petitions under Redline Three.”

Samantha had rehearsed so many versions of this moment that all of them scattered. She reached for the simplest. “I can pay in service. I can work. I can prove what I am, if belief is the price.”

“Belief is not the price,” the Administrator said. “Metal and time are the price. Also the safety of students, which costs more than either. We are at war. The University’s casters are seconded to the city defense and hospital. When the bells stop naming streets for retreat, we can speak of the outside again.”

The refusal was not cruel. That did not make it light. Samantha looked at the board where needs were written with numbers that did not care about prayers. Copper wire low. Alcohol down to two casks. Foxglove leaves to be rationed. Each line was a negation of a speech she had thought she might make.

She bowed her head, because that was the only move that did not waste anyone’s time. “I understand.” She looked up. “May I stand where I am useful now?”

The Administrator turned to Melf as if the answer lived with him, not because she deferred but because she allocated. “What do you need in the Crucible?”

“Hands that don’t panic when the coil coughs,” Melf said. “An eye for seams. Someone who can read chalk like a second language. She does all three.” His eyes flicked to Samantha for a confirming beat, not to ask permission but to make a small contract of trust.

“Granted,” the Administrator said. “You will receive a billet and a badge for internal movement. After the countermeasure is stable, you may request five minutes to speak to the triad. No promises beyond five minutes.”

Five minutes was a kingdom. “Thank you,” Samantha said. Hope moved in her like a small bird—alive, but wary of windows.

They went toward the Green Crucible, a long, low hall where working sigils made their own weather. The door exhaled a breath that smelled like vinegar, brass, damp wool, and oranges that had given their skins to someone else’s tincture. Inside, sigil‑lines traced the ceiling in quiet geometries; focus rings gleamed along the walls. A green‑banded crucible sulked in the corner as if it had opinions about being asked to work again.

“Steady,” Lareth said to the room. The words cut through chatter without being loud. “We’re being clocked.”

“As always,” Melf said, rolling his sleeves to his elbows. His forearms were strong in the way of people who lift things more important than themselves. “All right. Binder wash. We need something that makes the grit into a polite paste and slides out of grooves without scratching. Juniper resin? Vinegar? A breath of oil so it doesn’t seize.”

The work took breath and steadiness; Samantha felt the edges of fatigue the way a blade feels a whetstone—aware, but not dulled.

“Saltpeter is low,” a student called from a ledger.

“Then we’ll not ask it to dance,” Melf said. “Samantha?”

She stepped to the bench without feeling small. “Short and tight chalk marks set through it,” she said. “If the wash leaves a sheen, the chalk will skate. It needs a bite.”

“Good,” Melf said. “Bay oil for bite. A hair. Lareth, hold the hum where it is—no surges. If it scums, we’ve over‑asked the vinegar.”

“Holding,” Lareth said, and his palm steadied the sigil‑ring with the steadiness of a man who had learned long ago how to be a metronome.

Work took them.

Samantha ground juniper resin with a mortar worn smooth by stronger hands than hers, then bled vinegar in with a patience that felt like prayer but was not. The smell rose sharp and clean. A student brought bay leaves; she cracked one between her nails and let the oil thread the mix until the gloss shifted from slick to sure. Melf tuned the rune‑kiln with fingertip taps that made the copper sing. Lareth watched the glyphs and kept the working even, as if it had always wanted to be there.

They tested on a fouled stave taken from the wall. The wash turned the grit to mud that lifted under a cloth without scratching. Samantha drew a tightening curve with new chalk and felt it take as if the wood had been waiting for this exact shape to make sense again.

“It bites,” she said, unable to keep the small satisfaction out of her voice.

“It does,” Melf said, not looking up because his hands were busy making the next batch bigger. “We’ll need pails and sane people to carry them. We’ll need to teach the marks in three minutes to hands that feel like they have five.”

Lareth glanced to Samantha. “Your five minutes,” he said. “Earned sooner with this than any speech.”

“I meant to speak first,” she admitted, surprising herself. “I am better when I have said what I came to say.”

“You said it,” Melf said mildly. “Just not with your mouth.”

The door opened and the garden’s cold made a brief treaty with the room’s heat. The warden in the blue sash held out a tin badge stamped with the University’s seal—a stylized fjord and three spires. “For internal movement,” she said. “Don’t get lost. People do, even in straight halls, when they’re needed in more than one place.”

“I won’t,” Samantha said. She pinned the badge to her cloak and felt something small align. Not acceptance, not yet. A place to stand. The bells in the city were quieter now, and the steam rose steady where it met the cold.

## Aftermath
- Continuity links: [[01 - Siege at Coldreach]] → [[03 - TBD Next Scene]]
- Update character states: Samantha refused but redirected; earns a narrow hearing after countermeasure. Lareth trusts her under pressure. Melf formalizes her help as pedagogy.
- Loose ends: Admin triad hearing pending; resource shortfalls remain.
