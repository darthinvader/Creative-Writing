scene_type: infiltration → diplomacy
pov: Jarik Windmere (3rd-limited past)
location: Outer Harbor → Winterholme streets → WinterBy the time he crossed the outer quadrangle, night had settled across the stone. Behind him, the University breathed with controlled tension—order riding on preparation for crisis. Ahead, Winterholme's lamps guttered in the wind that came down the fjord like a warning. He adjusted his pace to suit a supplier completing evening business, neither hurried nor casual, and planned his next moves: first to the fish market to brief Mira on the successful contact, then to the rope guild to have Koln verify that no eastern agents had followed him back from the University, then to the Sailors' Rest to signal Torven with the blue lamp.

The evening's work had succeeded beyond his hopes. He had direct access to the University's authority, clear terms for cooperation, and a scheduled meeting to present Kandar's intelligence. Most crucially, he had confirmed that Administrator Vera Thricebind operated exactly as his network had reported—absolute authority, practical efficiency, and willingness to cooperate with legitimate partners who respected her command structure.

As he reached the harbor district, Jarik reflected on the advantages of having cultivated reliable local contacts over months of preparation. Torven's intelligence about Vera's leadership style had been precise. Mira's reports on eastern agent activity had provided crucial context. Dael's knowledge of University purchasing procedures had enabled the perfect cover identity. And Professor Hendricks' willingness to vouch for past business relationships had opened the door to the Administrator's office.

Tomorrow would bring the real test—whether Kandar's intelligence about Serathis threats would prove valuable enough to secure the cooperation they needed. But tonight's foundation was solid: direct access to decision-making authority, clear protocols for coordination, and a network of local assets positioned to support ongoing operations.

Jarik Windmere adjusted the sea-tithe knot at his belt and reminded himself to move like a merchant, not a spy. The weight of the copper-cored ring on his finger felt heavier than it should—a tangible reminder that King Alistair Dawnspear's authority reached even here, to the storm-lashed docks of a foreign harbor where failure meant more than professional embarrassment.

"Your crates passed inspection," the harbormaster said, tucking the scroll case into his coat with the practiced efficiency of a man who processed fifty such documents each day. "Medicinal salts, Kandaran wool, and Brightshore timber. Standard merchant manifest. Your docking fee covers three days; renewal available at the harbor office."

"My thanks," Jarik replied, letting his accent carry just enough of Kandar's coastal cadence to mark him as foreign without sounding exotic. "Is there a guild representative available? I'm hoping to establish purchasing agreements for next season's trade."

The harbormaster's eyes flicked to the knot at Jarik's belt—a practiced assessment that confirmed both legitimacy and value. "Dockmaster Orin handles the larger arrangements. You'll find him at the Sailors' Rest after sunset. Mention the blue cog and he'll know you're serious money."

Jarik nodded his thanks and watched the harbormaster walk toward the harbor office with official purpose. The first layer of his cover was now documented and defensible; anyone checking the manifest would find a Kandaran trader with legitimate business and proper credentials. It wouldn't survive deep scrutiny, but it would deflect casual attention.

He turned to survey the harbor, letting his gaze sweep across the pier approaches with the kind of professional interest a merchant might show when assessing local infrastructure. His attention caught on two figures in brown who stood too still beside a stack of barrel hoops, their positioning perfect for observation while maintaining plausible deniability.

*Serathis,* he thought, recognizing the tradecraft even if he couldn't identify the individuals. *Already in position. Either they followed me here or they've been watching the harbor for days.*

Neither option was particularly encouraging.

"Problems?" asked Torven, the local contact who'd approached him near the warehouse. The man wore dock worker's canvas with the casual authority of someone who belonged here, but his eyes carried intelligence that marked him as more than hired muscle. A small silver pin on his collar—barely visible unless one knew to look—identified him as one of the three operatives King Alistair had placed in Winterholme months ago.

"Observers," Jarik said quietly. "Fourth pier, brown clothing. Professional spacing, clean sight lines. They're not dock workers."

Torven's expression didn't change, but his posture shifted almost imperceptibly toward alertness. "Eastern agents, you think? Mira at the fish market mentioned strangers asking about shipping manifests yesterday. And Koln—you remember Koln from the rope guild—says there's been inquiries about warehouse space near the University district."

"Or local hire with eastern coin. Either way, we proceed carefully." Jarik began walking toward the pier's end, maintaining the unhurried pace of a man conducting ordinary business. "Status of the primary objective?"

"Confirmed," Torven said. "The Book is beneath Winter University, just as our intelligence suggested. But retrieval isn't feasible without inside cooperation. The wards are too complex and too well-maintained for external assault. And that's where Administrator Vera Thricebind becomes critical."

"Hence the diplomatic approach," Jarik murmured. He paused to examine a coil of rope with apparent merchant interest while actually checking the positions of the Serathis agents. They'd moved—one drifting toward the harbor office, the other angling toward his own position. Coordinated but not aggressive. Yet.

"Local political situation?" he asked.

"Centered entirely on the Administrator," Torven replied. "Vera Thricebind runs that University like a war captain. Professor Lareth Lakhart sets arcane policy and Professor Melf Maelstorm handles the dangerous experiments, but nothing—absolutely nothing—moves without Vera's approval. She's the single point of authority that matters."

"First gate?"

"Administrator Vera Thricebind," Torven said without hesitation. "She's the absolute authority. Professor Lakhart and Professor Maelstorm are influential, and there's a new woman—Samantha Seraphel—who's been useful to them, but they're advisors at best. Vera makes every decision that matters." He waved at a passing dock worker, keeping his posture casual. "Our contacts confirm she's brilliant, pragmatic, and completely unwilling to share authority. She'll listen to her professors, but she decides alone."

Jarik processed this while watching a merchant vessel adjust its mooring. A single authority figure simplified the diplomatic calculus considerably—one person to convince rather than managing a complex committee structure.

"Local assets?"

"Three reliable contacts in the city," Torven said, lowering his voice. "Mira at the fish market—she's been tracking unusual foreign activity for us. Koln in the rope guild provides access to trade information and warehouse movements. And Dael, who runs supplies to the University kitchens—he can get you inside the service areas if needed." He scratched at a splinter in the railing. "Plus Professor Hendricks from the University itself. He's handled Kandaran academic supply contracts before, remembers you favorably. Natural Philosophy department—he can vouch for your legitimacy."

"Approach vector?"

"Direct but respectful," Torven replied. "Vera Thricebind values efficiency and despises manipulation. Present Kandar's offer as genuine protection in exchange for academic cooperation. She'll respect honesty about our interests in the Book, but she'll shut down anyone who tries to pressure or deceive her. Our intelligence suggests she's dealt with eastern agents already and found them lacking in straight talk."

The Serathis agent approaching from the warehouse was closing distance with professional patience. Not an immediate threat, but definitely gathering intelligence. Jarik made a mental note of her position and continued the conversation.

"Timeline constraints?"

"Unknown, but urgent," Torven said. "Our intelligence indicates Serathis is preparing something significant—possibly an occupation attempt targeting the Administrator directly. If they eliminate Vera or force her evacuation, the University's command structure collapses and they can seize the Book during the chaos."

"The Paladin King's instructions become irrelevant," Jarik finished. King Alistair had been clear: secure Kandaran access to the Sword of Gosh by any means necessary, including cooperation with local authorities. But cooperation required there being local authorities left to cooperate with.

"Initial contact protocol?"

"Tonight, if possible. Dael has confirmed that Administrator Thricebind is holding evening meetings with department heads. Professor Hendricks can provide introduction, but Mira's already spread word through her market contacts that a legitimate Kandaran trader is in port." Torven paused as a cart loaded with grain sacks rumbled past. "Vera's efficient—she'll want to hear our proposal directly rather than through intermediaries."

"Verification requirements?"

"Vera will test our credentials thoroughly—the knot, the ring, probably a coin examination. Standard diplomatic protocol, but she's more thorough than most." Torven's expression grew serious. "She's also been burned by eastern promises before. Our contacts confirm she's had multiple meetings with Serathis representatives who made grand offers and delivered threats instead. She'll be skeptical of any foreign power claiming to help."

Jarik felt the familiar tension of a mission entering its critical phase. Weeks of preparation, days of travel, hours of positioning—all building toward a conversation with one woman who held absolute authority over his mission's success or failure. The Book of Gosh represented more than academic curiosity; it was the key to locating and potentially controlling the Sword of Gosh, the relic that could shift the balance of power across three kingdoms.

"Contingencies if the Administrator refuses?"

"Extract immediately," Torven said. "Vera Thricebind doesn't change her mind, and she doesn't give second chances. If she says no, any attempt to work around her authority will result in immediate expulsion—or worse. The University guard answers to her personally."

"And if Serathis moves against her first?"

Torven's smile was thin and professional. "Then we improvise. But understand—if Administrator Thricebind falls, the University falls with her. Everything depends on keeping her in power and cooperative."

The Serathis agent had positioned herself near a fish vendor's stall, close enough to observe while maintaining the pretense of commercial interest. Her partner had entered the harbor office, presumably to investigate Jarik's documentation or attempt bribery for information.

"Signal arrangements?"

"Blue lamp in the Sailors' Rest window means contact with the Administrator established. Red lamp means abort—Vera refused or Serathis moved first. No lamp..." Torven let the sentence hang.

"Understood." Jarik checked the sun's position—perhaps two hours until full darkness. Enough time to establish his merchant presence more thoroughly, but not enough to waste on elaborate preparations. "I'll need civilian clothes and a plausible reason to approach the Administrator directly."

"Already arranged. Academic supply merchant with contracts for alchemical components. Professor Hendricks will vouch for your prior dealings, and Dael can confirm you've done business with University purchasing before. Gives you legitimate reason to request an audience with Administrator Thricebind about expanding supply agreements."

"Excellent." Jarik began walking toward the shore, maintaining his merchant's assessment of local infrastructure while actually planning approach routes and escape vectors. Behind him, the Serathis agents maintained their surveillance with professional competence.

The game was beginning in earnest. Three kingdoms, three factions, and one Book that represented the key to power none of them could afford to lose.

Two hours later, Jarik stood before the iron gates of Winter University, transformed from merchant to academic supplier. His new clothes carried the practical quality of someone who dealt with dangerous materials—leather reinforced at joints, pockets designed for sample vials, the kind of measured caution that alchemists appreciated in their vendors. The transformation felt natural; he'd played similar roles in a dozen different cities.

The University perched above Winterholme like a guardian fortress, its towers carved from the same dark stone as the fjord cliffs. Ward-lights glittered along the walls in complex patterns that spoke to defensive preparations far beyond civilian requirements. Even from the approach road, Jarik could sense the layered enchantments that protected the institution—not just against casual intrusion, but against coordinated magical assault.

*Impressive,* he thought, cataloging the defensive measures with professional appreciation. *But also revealing. Universities don't maintain military-grade wards without expecting military-grade threats.*

"State your business," said the gate warden, a woman whose blue sash marked her as University staff rather than city guard. Her assessment was thorough but efficient—someone trained to distinguish between legitimate visitors and potential threats without causing unnecessary delays.

"Academic supplies," Jarik replied, producing documentation that Torven had provided. "Kandaran alchemical components for multiple departments. I have prior contracts with Professor Hendricks and wish to discuss expanded arrangements with Administrator Thricebind."

The warden examined his credentials with practiced competence. "Redline Three protocols are in effect. External suppliers require escort and advance authorization from the Administrator's office." She gestured toward a younger man in similar blue livery. "Marcus will guide you to the administrative wing. Any meetings with the Administrator require her personal approval."

As they walked through the University grounds, Jarik found himself impressed by the institution's organization despite its crisis footing. Students moved with purpose rather than panic, faculty maintained classroom schedules while clearly adapting to emergency protocols, and the overall atmosphere suggested an institution that had prepared for exactly this kind of coordinated pressure.

"Busy term," Jarik observed to his escort, letting his merchant persona show appropriate curiosity about conditions that might affect his business relationships.

"Crisis protocols," Marcus replied with the casual competence of someone who'd grown accustomed to emergency operations. "Coldreach refugees, supply rationing, faculty on city defense rotations. But Administrator Thricebind keeps everything running like clockwork. Never seen anything like her organizational ability."

"The Administrator?"

"Vera Thricebind. Half-orc lady who runs the entire operation—academics, security, supplies, everything." Marcus's respect was unmistakable. "She's been keeping this place functioning through siege conditions while half the city's in chaos. The faculty respect her completely, students trust her judgment, and even the city guard defers to her authority when University matters are involved."

Jarik filed this information with professional satisfaction. His intelligence had correctly identified Vera as the key decision-maker, but Marcus's comments suggested her authority was even more absolute than anticipated.

Marcus lowered his voice as they passed a notice board crowded with duty rosters. "Professor Hendricks can vouch for your prior business relationships, but any new contracts go through the Administrator personally. She approves every supplier, every purchase order, every access permission. Professors Lakhart and Maelstorm advise her on technical matters, but she makes the final decisions on everything." He tapped the board where organizational charts showed clear hierarchical lines. "Even Professor Lakhart—who's the High Mage—reports to her. Some suppliers try to work around her authority through department contacts, but that just gets them banned from campus permanently."

Jarik tucked the names away—three points of influence orbiting a fixed center.

"Is she available for meetings with suppliers?"

"Depends on the business and how you approach her. Administrator Thricebind is particular about time efficiency, but she recognizes that good supply relationships keep the University functioning." Marcus paused at an intersection where patrol routes converged. "Word of advice—she doesn't appreciate courtesy for courtesy's sake. State your business clearly, demonstrate genuine value, and respect her schedule. She's dealt with plenty of merchants who tried to charm their way to better terms or waste her time with elaborate presentations. Those people find themselves escorted off the grounds with remarkable speed."

They reached the administrative building as afternoon shadows began lengthening across the courtyard. The structure combined elegant architecture with practical fortification—wide windows for natural light, but positioned to avoid creating defensive vulnerabilities. Ward-stones hummed with protective energy that extended throughout the complex, creating interlocking fields of magical security.

"Administrative offices are through there," Marcus said, indicating a door marked with organizational symbols. "But if you want to request a meeting with Administrator Thricebind, you'll need to go through her personal secretary. Third floor, corner office. Fair warning—she screens all appointments personally and has final say on the Administrator's schedule."

Jarik thanked his escort and took a moment to assess his options. Building relationships with department contacts might provide useful intelligence, but King Alistair's mission required direct access to the person who actually made decisions. Every minute spent working through intermediaries was a minute that allowed Serathis to potentially eliminate or compromise the Administrator.

The choice wasn't difficult. King Alistair hadn't sent him to Winterholme to conduct routine commercial negotiations with junior faculty.

He climbed to the third floor, noting security measures that increased with each level—additional ward-stones, more sophisticated detection enchantments, and access points that would funnel visitors through controllable checkpoints. The University clearly understood that protecting its leadership required layered defenses against multiple categories of threat.

A junior clerk intercepted him, eyes flicking to the sea-tithe knot at his belt and the copper-cored ring on his finger. "State your business, sir?"

"Trade delegation from Kandar," Jarik replied, letting his accent mark him as foreign but not threatening. "I request an urgent audience with Administrator Vera Thricebind regarding academic procurement and mutual security interests that affect the University's continued independence."

The clerk hesitated, clearly recognizing both the diplomatic protocol and the implied urgency. "Wait here." Jarik watched the clerk disappear through heavy doors, noting the subtle warding sigils etched into the stone—evidence of Vera's reputation for personal security.

Minutes later, Jarik was ushered into Vera's office. The Administrator stood behind her desk, forearms scarred and posture unyielding. Her gaze was as precise as the ticking of her pocket watch, and the room's organization reflected absolute efficiency—every document in its place, every surface clear except for items requiring immediate attention.

"Your credentials are in order," Vera said, voice clipped and authoritative. "Professor Hendricks confirms your prior supply arrangements were handled competently. But your timing is suspect. Winterholme is under threat, and I have little patience for opportunistic diplomacy disguised as expanded trade agreements."

Jarik inclined his head respectfully. "Administrator Thricebind, Kandar offers more than trade. We have intelligence on Serathis movements and wish to coordinate for mutual benefit. My king's instructions are clear: support Winterholme's autonomy and the University's independence, provided we have supervised access to certain academic resources that can help us locate and neutralize threats to all our realms."

Vera's expression did not soften, but she remained attentive. "You mean the Book of Gosh. You're not the first to make such requests, and you won't be the last. My priority is the safety of my students and the integrity of the University. Any negotiation will be conducted on my terms, under my oversight, with my absolute authority over access and timing."

Jarik weighed his next words carefully. "Administrator, Kandar can offer protection—military, magical, and diplomatic support for the University's independence. But we require transparency about current threats. Serathis agents are already moving in the city, and our intelligence suggests they may be planning direct action against University leadership." He met her gaze directly. "If Winterholme falls or if you are eliminated, the Book will be lost to powers that would use it for conquest rather than protection."

He placed a single folded note on the edge of her desk. "For verification of my legitimacy—not as leverage. Professor Hendricks can vouch for my prior dealings with the University's Natural Philosophy department five winters ago. Routine supply contracts, documented, completed satisfactorily and on schedule."

Vera's stillness was absolute as she considered his words. "Protection is not a gift, Emissary. It is leverage disguised as generosity. I will consider your proposal, but understand this: the University operates under my authority alone. I decide what intelligence to accept, what cooperation to provide, and what access to grant. Any attempt to circumvent my command structure or pressure my faculty will result in your immediate expulsion from Winterholme."

Jarik nodded, recognizing both the boundaries and the opportunity. "Agreed, Administrator. My king values strong partners who maintain their own authority, not subordinates who require constant oversight. Kandar seeks cooperation with the University under your leadership, not control over it."

Vera turned to a ward journal, making a note with practiced efficiency. "You will submit your intelligence directly to my office—not to individual faculty members, not through intermediaries. In return, I will allow limited, supervised access to specific archives under my personal oversight. Professor Lakhart and Professor Maelstorm may advise me on technical aspects, but I make all decisions regarding what information you receive and when you receive it." She looked up sharply. "Any attempt to circumvent my authority by appealing to other faculty, offering private incentives, or operating without my explicit permission will result in immediate termination of all cooperation."

Jarik accepted the terms, understanding that the real negotiation had only just begun. This was exactly the kind of direct, efficient authority structure that King Alistair had hoped to find—a single decision-maker with absolute control over the resource they needed. "I appreciate your directness, Administrator. When should I return with the intelligence reports?"

"Tonight. My office, two hours after sunset. Bring documentation of Serathis positions, movement patterns, and any intelligence about threats to University leadership specifically." Vera's tone was businesslike. "I will review your materials and determine what cooperation is warranted. If your intelligence proves valuable and your intentions remain aligned with University interests, we can discuss expanded arrangements."

He paused in the corridor outside her office, letting the door's click fade into the thrumming ward-hum that pressed faintly against his teeth. The administrative wing ran like a warship: aides moving in purposeful patterns, messengers exchanging slates, the occasional faculty member slipping through with the distracted intensity of someone who knew exactly how much time a problem might permit before it became a crisis. It told him something important—Vera did not simply command; she orchestrated.

Jarik recorded the encounter in cipher on a narrow page he could palm if searched: Thricebind—direct; values process over platitude; accepts cooperation under her command; non-negotiables: student safety, institutional autonomy, chain-of-custody for knowledge. He added a mark beside the last line and underlined it twice. In places like this, knowledge was the coin and the battlefield.

On his way out, the secretary who had screened him earlier caught his eye. "If your 'mutual security interests' translate to unsupervised armed men inside my courtyards, you'll find the gates less welcoming tomorrow."

"Understood," he said. "Our liaisons will wear your colors when inside your walls and take orders from your officers. Written, countersigned."

The secretary's mouth twitched—the closest thing to approval he expected today. "Submit the names before midnight. Procurement closes at ninth bell, but my desk does not."

By the time he crossed the outer quadrangle, night had laid a cold sheen across the stone. Behind him, the University breathed—order riding on the back of strain. Ahead, Winterholme's lamps guttered in the wind that came down the fjord like a warning. He adjusted his pace to suit a supplier leaving late, neither furtive nor leisurely, and planned the relay: first to the Sailors' Rest to raise the blue lamp for Torven, then to the Lantern House back room for the University's reply, then—if fortune held—back through the same doors under new terms.

Notes: This consolidated Scene 10 merges the harbor cover (10B Emissary POV) with the University audience. 10B remains preserved in `Scenes/10 - Lines of Accord/10B - Emissary POV.md`. Focus remains on Administrator Vera as principal authority; Jarik’s approach is diplomatic under University protocols.
