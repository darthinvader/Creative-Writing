# Tengus

**Exceptionally powerful dark elf sorcerer seeking the artifacts of Gosh**

## Summary
A relatively young but extraordinarily powerful dark elf sorcerer (~100) seeking the [[Book of Gosh]] and [[Sword of Gosh]] for personal power. Former exile from [[Florian]] who endured decades of discrimination and persecution, now driven by a desire for power to punish those who wronged him and reshape the world according to his vision.

## Backstory & Motivation
### Origins in Florian
- **Early Life:** Born and raised in [[Florian]], faced systematic discrimination as a dark elf
- **Persecution:** Denied advancement, education, and opportunities due to racial prejudice
- **Exile:** Eventually driven from Florian through legal persecution or violent prejudice
- **Trauma:** Decades of mistreatment shaped his worldview and desire for power

### Current Motivation
- **Revenge:** Seeks power to punish those who persecuted him and his people
- **Restructuring:** Wants to use divine artifacts to reshape the social order
- **Recognition:** Desires to prove his superiority over those who dismissed him
- **Control:** Believes only through absolute power can justice be achieved

### Long-term Planning (Pre-Crisis)
- **Decades of Preparation:** Spent years studying Winter University's defenses and hidden chambers
- **Asset Positioning:** Carefully placed agents and contacts across multiple factions over many years
- **Intelligence Gathering:** Used Serathis networks as unwitting tools while pursuing his own agenda
- **Strategic Patience:** Willing to wait for the perfect moment when all factors align

## Abilities
- **Exceptional Magical Power:** Far beyond normal sorcerer capabilities—overpowered compared to University faculty
- **Shadow Mastery:** Expert in stealth, misdirection, and concealment magic
- **Structural Manipulation:** Can weaken building supports and create catastrophic failure points
- **Long-term Planning:** Decades of preparation, positioning, and resource gathering
- **Magical Compulsion:** Can control and manipulate other agents as tools
- **Counter-Scouting:** Skilled at avoiding detection while gathering intelligence

## Methods
- **Phase 1 - Infiltration:** Used Serathis agents as cover while working on the sealed chambers
- **Phase 2 - Manipulation:** Let Serathis believe they hired him while pursuing his own goals
- **Phase 3 - Ultimatum:** Issues 3-day warning before beginning his "true working"
- **Leverage:** Threatens to collapse entire University and town if opposed immediately
- **Strategic Patience:** Willing to wait decades and abandon current work if necessary

## Relationships
- **Tools:** Serathis agents (they think they hired him, he uses them as cover)
- **[[Elfina Maelstorm]]:** Unknowingly employs Melf's daughter as his "assistant"
- **Target:** [[Samantha Seraphel]] (needed for divine resonance in his working)
- **Rival:** [[Lady Vaelora Serath]] (he considers her "lacking vision")
- **Threat:** [[Administrator]] (will kill her in magical battle during his return)

## Character Arc
- **Tragic Villain:** His motivations stem from legitimate grievances and injustice
- **Corruption:** Pursuit of power has twisted his desire for justice into tyranny
- **Isolation:** His methods have cut him off from potential allies who share his goals
- **Downfall:** His paranoia and need for control may blind him to threats (like Elfina)

## Hooks & Resources
- May possess or trade critical pages from the [[Book of Gosh]]
- Has access to forbidden knowledge about the artifacts' true capabilities
- Commands resources sufficient to threaten an entire university
- Understands the connection between the artifacts and Baramoth's incursion potential
- His backstory provides opportunities for moral complexity in confrontations

## Threat Level
- **Magic**: Overpowered—direct magical confrontation inadvisable
- **Resources**: Significant—can threaten large groups simultaneously
- **Knowledge**: Extensive—knows more about the artifacts than most
- **Ruthlessness**: Absolute—will kill without hesitation if defied

## Fate
- Dies by the hand of [[Samantha Seraphel]] after precipitating the Baramoth incursion
- His pursuit of the artifacts ultimately leads to his own destruction

## Current Arc
- **Scene 03-04**: Begins covert investigation of [[Winter University]]
- **Scene 04+**: Escalates to direct confrontation and ultimatums
- **Future**: Forces the protagonists into impossible choices about the artifacts
