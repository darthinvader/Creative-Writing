# Tengus

- Summary: A relatively young but extraordinarily powerful dark elf sorcerer (~100) seeking the [[Book of Gosh]] and [[Sword of Gosh]] for his own purposes. Employs covert methods before revealing himself with lethal ultimatums. His power level exceeds that of typical mages—making direct confrontation nearly impossible.

## Motivation
- Seeks the paired artifacts to fulfill his pact with [[Baramoth (Demon God)]]
- Views the Book and Sword as tools to achieve unfathomable power and test his abilities before larger conquests
- Possible family tie to [[Lareth Lakhart]] makes him a personal threat as well as strategic one
- Unlike [[Lady Vaelora Serath]]'s diplomatic approach, Tengus prefers intimidation and force

## Abilities
- **Exceptional Magical Power**: Far beyond normal sorcerer capabilities—overpowered compared to University faculty
- **Shadow Mastery**: Expert in stealth, misdirection, and concealment magic
- **Scrying & Detection**: Can penetrate most magical defenses and wards
- **Lethal Spellcasting**: Capable of mass destruction when threatened
- **Counter-Scouting**: Skilled at avoiding detection while gathering intelligence
- **Arcane Negotiation**: Understands magical contracts and binding agreements

## Methods
- **Phase 1 - Covert**: Uses stealth, scrying, and infiltration to locate the artifacts
- **Phase 2 - Pressure**: Employs indirect threats and demonstrations of power
- **Phase 3 - Direct**: Open ultimatums backed by overwhelming magical force
- **Leverage**: May use [[Karol-Elf Maelstorm]] and [[Melfina Maelstorm]] as pressure points

## Relationships
- **Possible sibling**: [[Lareth Lakhart]] (unconfirmed, creates personal stakes)
- **Rival**: [[Lady Vaelora Serath]] and her Serathis agents (competing for same artifacts)
- **Target**: [[Samantha Seraphel]] (his eventual killer, according to fate)
- **Intelligence Network**: Contacts within East and West realms; monitored by Paladin King's agents

## Hooks & Resources
- May possess or trade critical pages from the [[Book of Gosh]]
- Has access to forbidden knowledge about the artifacts' true capabilities
- Commands resources sufficient to threaten an entire university
- Understands the connection between the artifacts and Baramoth's incursion potential

## Threat Level
- **Magic**: Overpowered—direct magical confrontation inadvisable
- **Resources**: Significant—can threaten large groups simultaneously
- **Knowledge**: Extensive—knows more about the artifacts than most
- **Ruthlessness**: Absolute—will kill without hesitation if defied

## Fate
- Dies by the hand of [[Samantha Seraphel]] after precipitating the Baramoth incursion
- His pursuit of the artifacts ultimately leads to his own destruction

## Current Arc
- **Scene 03-04**: Begins covert investigation of [[Winter University]]
- **Scene 04+**: Escalates to direct confrontation and ultimatums
- **Future**: Forces the protagonists into impossible choices about the artifacts
