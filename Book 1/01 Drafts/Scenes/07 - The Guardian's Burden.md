# 07 — The Guardian's Burden

Goal: Understand the true nature of the guardian's test before attempting to deny Tengus the Book of Gosh.
Conflict: Vera's thirty years of secrecy clash with urgent transparency needs; the test's history suggests failure might be worse than Tengus claiming the book.
Turn: Previous attempts didn't just fail—they transformed candidates into eternal servants, and the guardian has been containing these failures for decades.
Outcome: Samantha discovers her multiple divine connections might be the key, but also learns that success means accepting responsibility for judging the transformed.

The stone steps descended from Vera's restored office like a throat swallowing light. Each footfall echoed wrong—not the clean reverberation of normal architecture but something that seemed to bend around corners that shouldn't exist. Samantha followed the Administrator through passages that felt older than the University above, though she knew the building had stood for only three centuries.

"Every guardian learns these paths immediately," Vera said, her scarred hands trailing along walls carved with symbols that hurt to look at directly. "Not gradually, not through study. The moment you accept the ring, the knowledge burns itself into your mind. Thirty years ago, I woke screaming from dreams that weren't dreams but memories of every guardian before me."

The divine radiance that had been growing in Samantha since yesterday's confrontation with Tengus pulsed with each downward step. Her blessed sword—still stained with soot from Coldreach—hummed against her hip with increasing agitation. But beneath the familiar warmth of divine presence, she felt something else. An echo of old pain, old fear, old failure that made her silver pendant grow cold against her throat.

Behind them, Melf and Lareth followed in tense silence. She could hear Melf's palm occasionally brushing the walls, his stone-sense reading the University's terror. Lareth's lattice sight painted patterns she couldn't see but could feel—magical infrastructure twisted into geometries that belonged to no sane architect's vision.

"Tell me about the previous attempts," Samantha said, her voice steady despite the pressure building in her chest. "Vera, if I'm walking into this, I need to understand what I'm facing."

Vera paused at a landing where five corridors branched into darkness. The crystal ring on her hand—the one Tengus had named so casually—pulsed with sickly light that made shadows flee in directions gravity shouldn't allow. "The last serious attempt was thirty-two years ago. A paladin from the Southern Reaches. His order spent five years preparing him—divine blessings, mental conditioning, every ward against corruption they could devise."

"What happened?"

"He passed the first trial." Vera's voice carried weight that suggested the first trial had been the easy part. "Physical combat against the guardian's skeletal form. He was magnificent—holy light blazing, blessed blade singing hymns as it struck. We thought... I was young then, newly appointed. I thought divine authority would be enough."

They descended another flight, these stairs carved from stone that felt wrong under Samantha's boots—too smooth, too warm, as if something beneath still generated heat from processes better left unexamined.

"The second trial tested his choices," Vera continued. "Not his faith—his choices. The guardian showed him scenarios with no good outcomes. A plague that could only be stopped by poisoning innocents. A war that could only be ended by betraying allies. A child whose life would cause thousands of deaths."

"He couldn't choose?"

"He broke." Vera stopped walking, turning to face them in the dim light from her ring. "Perfect faith makes terrible decisions when reality offers only imperfect options. The guardian judged him unworthy, but..."

The pause stretched until Samantha felt compelled to prompt, "But?"

"But unworthy doesn't mean released. The guardian transformed him into something else. He's still down there, serving a purpose he never chose, maintaining wards he doesn't understand, speaking prophecies in languages that predate human speech."

Melf's sharp intake of breath echoed in the stairwell. "He's alive?"

"After a fashion. Seven failed candidates over three centuries, each transformed into servants of various kinds. The guardian doesn't waste resources—even failed ones."

Through the walls, Samantha's divine senses detected something vast and patient, waiting in chambers below. Not malevolent exactly, but utterly indifferent to human concepts of mercy or cruelty. Her Herald training had taught her to recognize divine authority, but this felt older—authority that existed before gods gave mortals names for it.

"You knew this when you asked me to attempt it," Samantha said, not quite making it a question.

"I knew it when I saw you hold divine radiance against Tengus without breaking." Vera resumed walking, her pace urgent now. "The others came seeking glory or duty. You came already carrying doubt about your own goddess's motives. That doubt might save you."

They reached another landing dominated by a door that thrummed with containment magic so powerful it made Samantha's teeth ache. Beyond it, she could feel the presence Vera had described—ancient, patient, and absolutely wrong by every standard her faith had taught her.

"Three days ago, you didn't know I existed," Samantha said quietly. "Now you're asking me to risk transformation into... whatever those seven became. Why?"

"Because in three days, you've shown more practical wisdom than thirty years of careful candidates." Vera pressed her palm against the door, and mechanisms older than the University groaned in response. "You didn't claim divine perfection when you arrived. You washed dishes and ground herbs. You admitted uncertainty about your own mission. You let Melf tie Lareth's bootlaces together during a crisis briefing without demanding military discipline."

"That hardly seems relevant to—"

"It's the most relevant thing I've seen." Vera turned to face her fully, and Samantha saw exhaustion deeper than physical fatigue in the Administrator's eyes. "The guardian doesn't test faith or power or courage. It tests whether you can remain human while wielding inhuman authority. Whether you can laugh at bootlace pranks while planning for apocalypse. Whether you can choose the least terrible option without losing yourself to either despair or self-righteousness."

Through the door, Samantha felt the guardian's attention shift—not awakening but acknowledging their presence. The sensation made her divine markings burn beneath her armor, not with pain but with recognition. Something in her nature, in the multiple divine connections she'd never fully understood, resonated with the chamber's purpose.

"Your heritage," Lareth said suddenly, his lattice sight revealing something others couldn't see. "Samantha, your divine markings aren't from a single source. I can see at least three distinct blessing patterns, maybe more. That's... that should be impossible."

"Unless," Melf said slowly, his scholarly mind racing ahead, "she was chosen specifically because multiple authorities recognized the same quality. Not competing blessings but convergent ones. Different aspects of divinity agreeing on a single point."

"Which is what?" Samantha asked, though part of her suspected she already knew.

"The ability to hold contradiction without breaking," Vera said simply. "To be both judge and advocate, warrior and healer, destroyer and protector. The guardian needs someone who already embodies paradox."

The door opened—not swinging but dissolving, revealing a chamber that shouldn't exist within normal architecture. The space beyond defied perspective, simultaneously vast and intimate, ancient and immediate. At its heart, something moved with the patience of geological time.

The guardian wasn't what Samantha expected. Not a dragon's skeleton animated by necromancy, but something worse—bones that had never quite been dragon, assembled into a shape that suggested what dragons might have been before reality settled on their current form. It moved without moving, existed without quite being present, watched without eyes from sockets that opened onto spaces between stars.

"The [[Book of Gosh]] rests within its ribcage," Vera said quietly. "To claim it, you must convince the guardian you're worthy. To destroy it, you must convince the guardian that destruction serves a greater purpose than preservation. To fail..." She gestured toward the chamber's edges, where shadows moved with too much purpose to be mere darkness.

Seven shadows. Seven failures. Seven warnings of what happened when divine authority met immovable truth and shattered.

"When?" Samantha asked, her hand finding her sword's hilt not for comfort but for the familiar weight of responsibility.

"Tengus gave us days. I'd prefer to attempt this before he returns with 'methods that don't require cooperation.'" Vera's scarred fingers worried at the crystal ring. "But rushing guarantees failure. The guardian can smell desperation like blood in water."

"Then we use the time we have," Samantha decided, feeling the weight of choice settling on her shoulders. "I need to understand what those seven became and why they failed. I need to know this University, this city, the people I'm supposedly protecting. And I need to understand what Tengus is truly after beyond just the book."

"Wise," Vera said with visible relief. "The guardian tests your ability to remain human while wielding inhuman authority. That means understanding what humanity you're trying to preserve."

"The infiltration networks Melf and Lareth mentioned," Samantha continued, her mind already working. "If Serathis has people throughout Winterholme, we need to map that threat. And the thieves' guild contact—Tiana. If we're going to protect this place, I should understand all the forces at work."

"I'll prepare the historical documentation," Vera said with renewed energy. "Guardian trial records, the transformation processes, what each failure taught us about the test's nature. You'll need weeks to properly absorb it all."

As they climbed back toward the surface, Samantha felt the guardian's attention following them—not hostile but evaluating, measuring, anticipating. Whatever test awaited, it had already begun the moment she'd acknowledged its existence. But now she had time to prepare properly.

Behind her, Melf cleared his throat thoughtfully. "There are University traditions you should experience," he said. "Faculty dinners, student debates, the morning herb garden rounds. If the guardian values humanity, it might help to understand the community you're protecting."

"And the defensive networks," Lareth added with growing enthusiasm. "Captain Aldara mentioned city-wide coordination protocols. You should meet the people who'll be implementing them—guards, ward-tenders, emergency coordinators."

The gesture was small, the bond still fragile, but their willingness to plan together anchored something in Samantha's chest. She'd come to Codaria seeking a magical ally for her kingdom. She'd found something rarer—people who saw her as more than her divine role, even if they barely knew her yet.

As they emerged into Vera's office, morning light streaming through windows that had been hastily repaired, Samantha realized the true test wouldn't be combat or wisdom or faith. It would be remaining herself while everyone—gods, guardians, and transformed failures—tried to make her into something else.

But now she had time to discover who that self truly was, beyond her Herald training and divine markings. Time to understand the University, the city, and the people whose lives would be shaped by her choices. Time to build the bonds that might anchor her humanity when the guardian's test tried to strip it away.

The countdown to Tengus's return continued, but now it measured opportunity as much as threat. Days to prepare, to learn, to become worthy not through divine perfection but through understanding what made life worth protecting.

Seven failures waited below to teach her their lessons.
The living waited above to show her what those lessons meant.

*Notes: Revised to focus on preparation rather than immediate action, maintaining proper timeline continuity. This allows for the 17-day gap before the actual guardian confrontation (Y1 M1 D22), during which Samantha can experience University life, build deeper relationships with Melf and Lareth, investigate Serathis infiltration networks, and work with Tiana's thieves' guild and Captain Aldara's city defenses. The scene now sets up character bonding opportunities and community integration that will make her eventual test more meaningful.*
