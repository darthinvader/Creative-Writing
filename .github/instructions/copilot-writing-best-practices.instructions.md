## Copilot Writing Best Practices

- Keep prompts short, specific, and outcome-driven; list constraints (POV/tense, tone, wordcount, content limits).
- Use Reasoning â†’ Deliverable; prefer bullets for planning, prose for drafting.
- For drafting: set POV, tense, wordcount band, and an emotional turn.
- Chunk by scene; avoid multi-chapter in one go. Reference canon with wikilinks.
- Use templates in `Book 1/07 Templates/`; keep frontmatter minimal and valid YAML.
- For Obsidian: keep filenames sluggified; add [[Glossary]] and [[Timeline]] links.
- Optional JSON when structure helps (beats, arcs, timeline events).
- Safety: avoid harmful content; suggest respectful alternatives.
