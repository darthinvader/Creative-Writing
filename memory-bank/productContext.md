# Product Context

Why this exists
- Build a consistent, linked canon and draft for a modern, vivid fantasy novel set in Codaria.

Value
- Readers: Rule-bound magic with costs; character-first stakes; clean, punchy prose.
- Author: Structured vault that preserves decisions and speeds revision.

Audience & Positioning
- Readers who enjoy Sanderson-esque systems with a tighter, character-forward focus.
- Tone: Grounded wonder, wartime urgency, quiet spirituality.

Experience Goals
- Feel the siege → hubris → costly victory arc.
- See magic rules and limits honored; costs paid on-page.

Workflows
- Plan beats → draft scenes → revise chapters → update glossary/timeline.
- Keep [[Glossary]] synced with new terms; scenes link to beats/timeline.
