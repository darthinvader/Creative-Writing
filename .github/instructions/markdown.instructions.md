## Markdown Content Rules (Obsidian)

1. Headings: Use `##` and `###`. Avoid `#` (Obsidian shows filename as title).
2. Lists: Use `-` for bullets, `1.` for ordered; indent nested lists by two spaces.
3. Code Blocks: Use fenced blocks and specify language when relevant.
4. Links: Prefer Obsidian wikilinks `[[Note Name]]`; use markdown links for external URLs.
5. Images: Use standard markdown; include alt text.
6. Tables: Keep minimal and readable.
7. Line Length: Soft-wrap is fine; keep paragraphs readable (< 400 chars preferred).
8. Whitespace: Blank lines between sections; avoid extra blank lines.
9. Frontmatter: Use only when templates require it (see `Book 1/07 Templates/Frontmatter Fields.md`).

## Writing-Specific Guidelines

- Fantasy-first: concrete sensory detail; internal conflict; rule-based magic with costs.
- Canon: align with `Book 1/03 Worldbuilding/` and `Book 1/06 References/`.
- Spoilers: avoid across files unless requested; use spoiler-safe notes.
- Tags & Links: add relevant tags and wikilinks to connect notes.

## Output Hygiene

- Include “Suggested file path” for generated artifacts mapped under `Book 1/...`.
- Offer JSON on request for structured data (beats, timeline, arcs).
