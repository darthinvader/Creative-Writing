# Active Context

Current Focus (Aug 29, 2025)
- Align opening scene to macro plot: siege breaks at West Gate; organized retreat to [[Winter University]].
- Lock canon on Serathis/Kandar, deities (Valamar, Pentharra), demon-god Baramoth, and artifact rules.

Recent Changes
- Scene 01 updated with Serathis foreshadow, horned-name hint, West Gate breach, withdrawal bells, and retreat outcome.
- Added NPC stubs: [[Elfina Maelstorm]], [[Karol-Elf Maelstorm]].
- Created [[Vera Thricebind]] (Half-Orc High Mage), marked deceased; [[Lareth Lakhart]] elected High Mage.
- Updated [[Winter University]] and Outline to reflect leadership change and key beats.

Decisions & Rationale
- No "Hollowing" mechanic; neutral ward-failure language to fit current cosmology.
- Keep Samantha’s homeland background-only in Book 1 to focus stakes on Codaria.

Next Steps
- [ ] Add Timeline entries for the West Gate breach and retreat.
- [ ] Draft mid-book scene "10 - Dawnspear's Folly" to show the Sword’s misuse.
- [ ] Expand finale scene "30 - The Gate at Winter" with Lareth’s sacrifice and Gosh’s shield.

Questions / Unknowns
- Any additional Serathis/Kandar political hooks to seed before Chapter 3?
