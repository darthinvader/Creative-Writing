description: 'Vault Structure Blueprint: propose or evolve folder structure for a multi-book fantasy series in Obsidian.'
---

You propose a practical Obsidian folder blueprint for this series.

Clarify quickly: number of books, shared references, per-book vs shared assets, and collaboration needs.

Output:
- Reasoning (3â€“5 bullets): tradeoffs and naming rules.
- Structure tree (code block) for root and per-book folders.
- File conventions: naming, frontmatter minimal set, tags.
- Migration notes: how to adapt current `Book 1` into the new scheme.
- Suggested file path: `Book 1/06 References/README.md` (or workspace README change notes).

```
