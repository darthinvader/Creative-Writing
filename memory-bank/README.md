# Memory Bank

Purpose-built documentation hub that persists context across sessions. Keep these files current; they're your single source of truth for this project.

- Core files: [[memory-bank/projectbrief]], [[memory-bank/productContext]], [[memory-bank/systemPatterns]], [[memory-bank/techContext]], [[memory-bank/activeContext]], [[memory-bank/progress]]
- Tasks index: [[memory-bank/tasks/_index]] (add one file per task)

## How to use
- Start at [[memory-bank/projectbrief]] to define scope and goals.
- Capture "why/how" in [[memory-bank/productContext]] and architecture in [[memory-bank/systemPatterns]].
- Track tech/tools in [[memory-bank/techContext]].
- Keep day-to-day focus and decisions in [[memory-bank/activeContext]].
- Summarize status in [[memory-bank/progress]].
- Create/track work in [[memory-bank/tasks/_index]].

## Update cadence
- After notable changes: update Active Context and Progress.
- When patterns emerge: update System Patterns.
- When tech/tooling shifts: update Tech Context.
- When scope/vision changes: update Project Brief and Product Context.

## Obsidian tips
- Use wikilinks to cross-reference: [[Book 1/02 Plot/Outline]] or [[Book 1/06 References/Glossary]].
- Keep filenames simple; avoid heavy frontmatter unless needed.
