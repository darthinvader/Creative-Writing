# Progress

What Works
- Core macro plot and stakes are defined (Serathis/Kandar/Codaria; Baramoth threat; artifacts of Gosh).
- Opening Scene 01 revised to set retreat and foreshadowing.
- Winter University leadership change captured (Gorran dies; Lareth elected).

What's Left to Build
- Draft "10 - Dawnspear's Folly" and expand "30 - The Gate at Winter".
- Add Timeline entries for siege breach and retreat.
- Fill out NPCs and political hooks for Serathis/Kandar.

Known Issues
- Ensure consistent casing and links (e.g., "Karol-Elf").
- Keep ward-failure language neutral (no deprecated terms).

Milestones
- Sep 05: Mid-book scene draft complete.
- Sep 12: Finale expansion pass complete.

Status Summary
Steady progress: opener aligned to outline; canon tightened; next focus is mid-book and finale beats.
