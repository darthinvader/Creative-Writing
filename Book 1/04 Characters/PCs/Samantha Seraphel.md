# Samantha Seraphel

- Pronunciation: sah-MAN-tha SEH-rah-fell
- Height: 1.75 m
- Appearance: White human with golden blonde hair; reasonable build concealing great strength and muscle—deceptively powerful physique
 - Occupation: Paladin-Emissary (Herald of Valamar)
 - Faith: Valamar (Platinum Dragon)
- Affiliation: [[Codaria]] (visitor), allied with faculty at [[Winter University]]; sister is Queen of [[Whitehaven]] (Erandia)
- Goal: Find a great spellcaster to aid her nation against a covert divine conflict (background; not a book-1 plotline).
- Motivation: Loyalty to her god and people; a sense of duty and justice.
- Conflict: Her homeland is considered a myth; enemy god’s agents sap magic from casters and undermine faith. Her true nature (angelic) remains hidden, even from her.
- Stakes: If she fails, her god’s influence wanes and her country collapses into silence.

## GMC (Goal • Motivation • Conflict)
- Goal: Recruit a master spellcaster capable of countering a grand ritual draining magic (background aim; Book 1 focuses on Codaria’s crisis).
- Motivation: Duty as a Herald; compassion and order aligned with her god; protect innocents first.
- Conflict: Disbelief about Erandia’s existence; foreign interference; personal inexperience; latent angelic nature complicates signs and rites.

## Wounds & Fears
- Wound: Exiled by circumstance—left when few believed her story.
- Fear: Being dismissed as a liar or zealot; losing the last link to her faith.
 - Faith State: Nearly unshakable; under strain she suffers depletion, not doubt (risk: Concord Fracture = temporary clarity loss, remedied by rest/rite).

## Abilities
- Close‑quarters weapon mastery: disciplined strikes, joint control, efficient disarms; trained in precise, economy-of-motion combat.
- Empowered Smite: focused divine strike ("Valamar") that adds controlled force to a blow; used sparingly and precisely with measured restraint.
- Ward maintenance: can identify fouled magical staves and perform basic counter-marking to restore function.
- Paladin rites (oaths, warding steadies, protective auras); Herald authority in sacred spaces.
 - Concord Channel: her covenant stabilizes coupling to [[Magic System — The Lattice|The Lattice]]; costs land as exertion and clarity—she tires, but her edge stays clean.
- Keen intuition for divine‑magic anomalies; unconscious angelic resilience.
- Polite diplomacy with stubborn persistence.

## Relationships
- Sister: Queen of [[Whitehaven]] (Erandia), distant but formative.
- Emerging allies: [[Melf Maelstorm]], [[Lareth Lakhart]] — earned their respect through competent action during the Coldreach siege.
- Respectful toward scholars at [[Winter University]].

## Arc Notes
- Act I: Outsider seeking legitimacy; learns to frame truth for skeptical audiences.
- Act II: Proves Codaria’s threat is real; catalyzes cooperation between rival disciplines.
- Act III: Chooses protection of the present over distant crusade; hints of true nature surface.

## Voice Cues
- Earnest, precise, respectful; observes before asserting.
- Uses religious metaphors quietly; avoids proselytizing.
 - Moves with disciplined economy; awareness sharpened by training.

## Continuity
- Her homeland’s name and exact location TBD; maintain mystery but drop concrete sensory details (architecture, textiles, prayers) to make it feel real.
