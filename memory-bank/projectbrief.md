# Project Brief

Purpose
- Produce Book 1 of a fantasy novel set in Codaria: artifact conflict around the Sword/Book of Gosh, siege of [[Coldreach]], and finale at [[Winter University]].

Goals & Scope
- Tell Samantha Seraphel, Melf Maelstorm, and Lareth Lakhart’s story across one novel.
- Focus on Codaria; keep Samantha’s homeland background-only in Book 1.
- Integrate three powers: [[Serathis]] (Lady Vaelora Serath), [[Kandar]] (Paladin King Alistair Dawnspear), and Codaria.

Success Criteria
- Complete outline + scene drafts for key tentpoles (opener, Dawnspear’s Folly, The Gate at Winter).
- Consistent canon in [[Glossary]] and cross-links between scenes/plot.
- Opening chapter revised to match outline (retreat from Coldreach).

Constraints
- Markdown/Obsidian only; minimal frontmatter.
- Safety: avoid harmful content; use respectful alternatives.

Readers
- Primary: author and future beta readers of modern fantasy with rule-bound magic.
