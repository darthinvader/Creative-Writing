Jarik had expected negotiations to be formal and slow—ink-laden petitions, careful phrases, and the inevitable requests for additional references. He had not expected Administrator Vera Thricebind to demand immediate intelligence briefings and actionable cooperation within hours of their first meeting.

The fish market operated differently after sunset. Mira's stall transformed from a legitimate seafood vendor into a discrete information exchange, with the scent of brine and ice providing perfect cover for whispered conversations. When Jarik approached with the agreed-upon phrase about "tomorrow's weather affecting harbor conditions," she immediately ushered him behind stacked crates where they could speak freely.

"Contact established?" she asked, her weathered hands continuing to sort through the day's remaining inventory with practiced efficiency.

"Successful. Direct access to Administrator Thricebind, scheduled intelligence briefing tonight." Jarik kept his voice low while his eyes tracked the movement of other market vendors closing their stalls. "What's the current situation with eastern agents?"

Mira's expression grew serious. "Three confirmed Serathis operatives in the district since yesterday. One's been asking questions about University staff schedules—specifically about the Administrator's evening routines. Another tried to bribe Koln for information about warehouse access near the University. The third has been watching the administrative building from the Crescent Moon inn."

Jarik filed this information with professional concern. Serathis interest in Vera's personal schedule suggested they might be planning direct action against University leadership, exactly as his king's intelligence had predicted.

"Any indication they know about Kandaran presence?"

"Not specifically, but they're definitely aware that foreign interests are active. Dael mentioned that someone approached him about University supplier access yesterday—eastern accent, offered significant coin for information about procurement procedures." Mira wrapped a selection of fish in oiled cloth with the casual competence of someone who used food sales to cover intelligence work. "I told him to be helpful but not informative. Standard protocol."

"Excellent. I need you to monitor eastern movements near the University district specifically. Administrator Thricebind is the critical asset—if Serathis eliminates or compromises her, the entire mission fails." Jarik paused as a late customer approached Mira's stall, waiting until the transaction concluded before continuing. "Professor Hendricks proved helpful with introductions, but everything depends on maintaining the Administrator's trust and cooperation."

"Understood. What about Koln and the rope guild?"

"I'll brief him next, then signal Torven. The Administrator wants comprehensive intelligence about threats to University leadership—Koln's warehouse contacts will be essential for tracking Serathis supply movements and potential staging areas."

Twenty minutes later, Jarik found Koln in the rope guild's workshop, where the older man was inspecting cordage under the light of hanging oil lamps. The workshop provided ideal conditions for discrete conversation—the sound of creaking rope and settling timber would mask their voices from casual eavesdroppers.

"Successful contact with the University?" Koln asked without preamble, his hands continuing to test knots and splice points while he spoke.

"Direct access to Administrator Thricebind. She's agreed to receive intelligence about Serathis activities, particularly threats to University leadership." Jarik examined a coil of ship's line while speaking, maintaining the appearance of commercial discussion. "What have you learned about eastern warehouse requirements?"

"Troubling patterns," Koln replied. "Three separate inquiries about storage space within a quarter-mile of the University district. All from intermediaries, but the descriptions match typical Serathis advance planning. They're looking for secure storage with rear access and sight lines to the administrative building."

"Positions for surveillance or staging areas for direct action?"

"Both, most likely. The specifications suggest they want options—passive observation capability that can escalate to active operations if circumstances require." Koln set down the rope he'd been testing. "I've been providing information that appears helpful while directing them toward locations that would actually disadvantage any hostile operations."

"Perfect. Continue that approach, but document everything. Administrator Thricebind needs precise intelligence about Serathis capabilities and intentions." Jarik lowered his voice further. "She's the absolute authority for University decisions. If we can demonstrate that Kandar's intelligence protects her ability to maintain that authority, we establish the cooperation framework my king requires."

An hour later, Jarik stood once again in Administrator Vera Thricebind's office, but the atmosphere was markedly different from their afternoon meeting. Night had transformed the University into a fortress under siege conditions—additional guard patrols, enhanced ward-lights, and the subtle tension that indicated an institution preparing for potential threats.

Vera sat behind her desk with a collection of documents spread before her, each marked with different colored ink that suggested a sophisticated filing system. Her attention was absolute as Jarik presented the intelligence his network had gathered.

"Three confirmed Serathis operatives," he reported, placing sketched descriptions and location details on her desk. "Mira confirms one has been inquiring about your personal schedule and evening routines. Koln reports multiple requests for warehouse space with sight lines to this building. Our assessment is that they're preparing for direct action against University leadership."

Vera examined the documents with professional thoroughness, her scarred fingers tracing locations on a detailed map of Winterholme. "These positions would allow coordinated surveillance and rapid movement toward the administrative quarter. Have your contacts identified their command structure?"

"Not yet, but we're tracking their communications through Dael's observations of University supplier interactions. They appear to be operating under local covers, but with eastern coordination." Jarik placed additional pages on her desk. "Kandar's coastal watchers have also confirmed unusual shipping activity—vessels that arrive at night and unload cargo without proper manifests."

"Weapons? Personnel? Magical components?"

"Unknown cargo, but the patterns suggest preparation for extended operations rather than simple infiltration." Jarik met her gaze directly. "Administrator, our intelligence indicates they may be targeting you specifically. If University leadership is eliminated or compromised, institutional resistance to occupation becomes impossible."

Vera's expression remained composed, but her hands moved to the ward-journal at her side. "What does Kandar propose?"

"Immediate protective coordination. Liaison officers under your command to provide additional security for key University personnel. Intelligence sharing to identify threats before they develop into direct action. Material support for enhanced defenses." Jarik paused. "All under your authority, with your approval for every operational decision."

"And in return?"

"Supervised access to specific archives that can help us verify intelligence about the artifacts Serathis seeks. Coordination that prevents University resources from falling into hostile hands." Jarik's tone remained respectful but clear. "My king's primary interest is preventing Serathis expansion. Supporting the University's independence serves that goal."

Vera made notes in her ward-journal, each entry precise and economical. "I will accept limited liaison support—two officers maximum, operating under University protocols, subject to immediate dismissal if they violate my authority. Intelligence sharing will be bidirectional—you provide information about threats to University personnel, and I will share relevant information about defensive preparations."

"Agreed. What about archive access?"

"Supervised and limited. You may examine specific documents related to ward patterns and historical security measures, but only in my presence or that of designated faculty." Vera's tone brooked no negotiation. "Any attempt to access restricted materials without explicit authorization will terminate all cooperation immediately."

Jarik nodded, recognizing both the opportunity and the boundaries. "Administrator, I believe this arrangement serves both our interests. Kandar gains the information needed to counter Serathis expansion, and the University maintains the authority structure necessary for institutional independence."

"We shall see." Vera stood, indicating the formal briefing was concluding. "Your intelligence about threats to University leadership has been noted and will inform our security preparations. Report any additional information through my office directly—not through individual faculty members or staff."

As Jarik prepared to leave, Vera added quietly, "Emissary, understand that the University's cooperation depends entirely on results. If your intelligence proves accurate and your officers respect our authority, this partnership may develop further. If either fails..." She left the consequences unspoken but clear.

Leaving the administrative building, Jarik felt cautiously optimistic about the evening's progress. He had established formal intelligence cooperation with the University's absolute authority, provided valuable information about immediate threats, and secured limited access to the archives his mission required. Most importantly, he had demonstrated Kandar's value as a partner while respecting the command structure that made such partnership possible.

He paused at the University gates to observe the enhanced security measures Vera had implemented following his briefing. Additional ward-lights illuminated potential approach routes, guard patrols had been repositioned to cover administrative areas, and faculty members were moving with the purposeful efficiency of people operating under crisis protocols.

Behind him, the University breathed with disciplined readiness—an institution that had received credible threat intelligence and was responding with competent preparation. Ahead, Winterholme's harbor district waited, where his network of contacts would continue monitoring Serathis activities and gathering the intelligence that kept Administrator Thricebind's cooperation both informed and valuable.

The balance of power in Winterholme remained delicate, but for the first time since arriving, Jarik felt confident that Kandar's interests aligned with local stability rather than conflicting with it. Everything depended on maintaining that alignment—and on ensuring that Administrator Vera Thricebind remained in command of the University long enough for their cooperation to achieve its objectives.

However, as Torven had briefed him during preparation, the University operated as only one power center in Winterholme's complex political landscape. The city itself maintained its own governance structure, and any lasting diplomatic arrangement would require understanding—and potentially engaging with—the broader municipal authority.

## The Harbor Council Meeting

Two hours past midnight, Jarik found himself in the Merchants' Assembly Hall, a stone building near the harbor that served as Winterholme's seat of civic government. The structure lacked the University's magical defenses, but its thick walls and narrow windows spoke to different kinds of security concerns—protection against both storms and the political tempests that could destroy a trading city's prosperity.

Torven had arranged this meeting with careful attention to protocol. "The Harbor Council runs Winterholme's day-to-day operations," he had explained earlier. "Five members: trade representative, guild coordinator, harbor master, city militia captain, and the magistrate who handles legal disputes. They're practical people, but they've been struggling since Coldreach fell and the eastern pressure started building."

The council chamber was lit by oil lamps rather than ward-lights, creating dancing shadows that emphasized the weariness in the faces of the five officials who had agreed to this late-night consultation. Jarik recognized the political calculation—meeting after normal hours reduced the chance of eastern agents observing the proceedings, but it also signaled the urgency underlying Winterholme's current circumstances.

"Emissary Windmere," said Councilor Thane Blackwater, a gray-bearded man whose callused hands marked him as the trade representative. "Torven says you represent Kandaran interests and have intelligence about threats to our city's independence. We appreciate directness—our time for elaborate diplomacy ended when Coldreach burned."

Jarik inclined his head respectfully. "Councilor Blackwater, Kandar offers both intelligence and material support. Our coastal watchers have tracked unusual Serathis shipping activity, and our agents in the city have identified specific threats to key leadership figures. We believe coordinated response benefits both our realms."

"Leadership figures," repeated Captain Aldara, who served as the council's militia coordinator in addition to her University security duties. Her scarred face reflected the tactical thinking that had kept Winterholme's defenses functional during the siege. "You mean Administrator Thricebind specifically, or broader targets?"

"Both. Our intelligence indicates Serathis strategy focuses on eliminating or compromising institutional leadership to enable occupation without prolonged resistance." Jarik placed a map on the council table, noting how each member leaned forward to examine the marked positions. "University leadership is a primary target, but city governance would be secondary objectives in any comprehensive takeover attempt."

Harbormaster Orin, a weathered woman who controlled the port that kept Winterholme economically viable, traced shipping lanes with her finger. "These vessel positions match unusual activity I've been tracking. Ships arriving without proper manifests, unloading at private docks, avoiding standard customs procedures." She looked up sharply. "How extensive is Kandar's intelligence network?"

"Sufficient to provide early warning about threats to city independence," Jarik replied carefully. "Our king values stable trading partners over territorial expansion. Supporting Winterholme's autonomy serves Kandaran commercial interests."

Guild Coordinator Malen Stonehammer, whose authority extended over the craft organizations that provided the city's economic foundation, leaned back in his chair. "Support sounds appealing, but it usually comes with obligations. What does Kandar want in exchange for this intelligence and protection?"

"Trade agreements that ensure continued access to northern goods. Diplomatic coordination to present a unified front against eastern expansion. And..." Jarik paused, weighing his words carefully, "access to specific academic resources that can help verify threats and develop appropriate countermeasures."

"The University," Magistrate Eldra Brightforge said bluntly. She was younger than the other council members, but her legal training had taught her to identify the core issues beneath diplomatic language. "You want access to University resources, but you're talking to us because you understand the city has its own authority structure."

"Precisely, Magistrate. Administrator Thricebind commands the University absolutely, but the city maintains its own governance. Any lasting arrangement requires coordination between both power structures." Jarik met each council member's gaze in turn. "Kandar seeks cooperation with legitimate authority, not replacement of it."

Captain Aldara leaned forward. "Our current security arrangement divides responsibility between University and city forces. University guards handle campus security and magical threats, while city militia manages broader defensive requirements. How would Kandaran involvement affect that balance?"

"By strengthening both systems without altering command structures. Kandaran liaison officers would operate under existing authority—University officers under Administrator Thricebind's command, city officers under Harbor Council direction." Jarik pulled additional documents from his case. "We propose parallel cooperation rather than unified command."

Harbormaster Orin examined the shipping intelligence with professional interest. "This information about eastern vessel movements—if accurate, it gives us advance warning to implement port security measures. But verification requires ongoing intelligence sharing."

"Which Kandar is prepared to provide, contingent on reciprocal cooperation." Jarik placed a formal document on the table. "This proposal outlines intelligence sharing protocols, material support arrangements, and trade agreements that benefit both parties while preserving Winterholme's independence."

Councilor Blackwater read through the proposal with merchant efficiency. "Trade terms are reasonable. Security cooperation is structured to supplement rather than replace local authority. But this requires Harbor Council approval, and we don't make such decisions without careful consideration."

"How long for deliberation?" Jarik asked.

"Twenty-four hours minimum," Magistrate Brightforge replied. "We need to review the legal implications and consult with relevant guild representatives. This affects the entire city, not just council members."

Guild Coordinator Stonehammer nodded. "My members will want guarantees that Kandaran presence doesn't disrupt existing craft arrangements or create unfair competition. Support is welcome, but not at the cost of local economic stability."

"Understood. The proposal includes provisions for local preference in supply contracts and guild consultation on any economic arrangements." Jarik gathered his papers. "Kandar's interests focus on preventing eastern occupation, not replacing local commerce."

Captain Aldara stood, her military bearing evident despite the late hour. "Emissary, I'll be coordinating with Administrator Thricebind about University security measures. If this council approves cooperation, integration between city and University defensive planning becomes critical."

"Agreed, Captain. Kandaran liaison officers would facilitate that coordination while respecting both command structures." Jarik paused at the chamber door. "Council members, I believe time favors decisive action. Serathis agents are already positioning for expanded operations—delay increases the risk they achieve their objectives before defensive measures can be implemented."

As the council members began discussing next steps, Jarik left the assembly hall with a complex mixture of satisfaction and concern. He had established contact with Winterholme's civic authority and presented a proposal that addressed their concerns while advancing Kandaran objectives. However, the need for formal deliberation introduced timing complications that could prove problematic if Serathis moved quickly.

Walking through Winterholme's quiet streets toward his lodging, Jarik reflected on the political map he was gradually comprehending. The University operated with significant autonomy under Vera Thricebind's absolute authority, but it existed within a city that maintained its own governance through the Harbor Council. Successful diplomacy required managing both relationships without creating conflicts between them.

His network of local contacts—Mira, Koln, Dael, and Torven—would be essential for monitoring how these political dynamics developed. Most importantly, he needed to ensure that cooperation between Kandar and the University didn't create tensions with city authorities that could undermine the broader diplomatic framework.

Tomorrow would bring the Harbor Council's decision and the next phase of negotiations with Administrator Thricebind. The foundation for partnership was solid, but transforming it into lasting cooperation would require navigating the complex interplay between University independence and city governance that defined Winterholme's unique political structure.
