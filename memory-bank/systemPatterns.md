# System Patterns

Architecture
- Work lives under `Book 1/`; Memory Bank holds meta (scope, decisions, status).

Information Architecture
- Drafts: `Book 1/01 Drafts/` (Scenes, Chapters).
- Plot: `Book 1/02 Plot/` (Act Structure, Beat Sheet, Outline, Timeline, Arcs).
- Canon: `Book 1/06 References/` (Glossary, Pronunciation, Session Logs).

Linking
- Wikilinks everywhere; scenes reference beats and timeline.
- Keep new terms in [[Book 1/06 References/Glossary]].

Templates & Frontmatter
- Use `Book 1/07 Templates/`; keep YAML minimal (per Frontmatter Fields).

Changelog
- Log notable shifts in [[memory-bank/progress]] and `Book 1/08 Editing/Changelog`.
