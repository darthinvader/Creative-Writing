# Creative Writing Vault

This repository tracks the entire Obsidian vault for your creative writing projects.

- Root repo: version controls notes and Obsidian settings (except volatile workspace files)
- Book folders (e.g., `Book 1/`) contain drafts, plot, characters, locations, and templates
- Assets live under `99 Assets/`

Git tips:
- Stage and commit regularly: `git add .` then `git commit -m "message"`
- Only one Git repo exists (at this root). Do not init nested repos.
