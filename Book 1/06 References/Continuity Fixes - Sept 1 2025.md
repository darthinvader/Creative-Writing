# Continuity Fixes Applied - September 1, 2025

## Character Name Corrections
- **Locations corrected**: Scenes 03.5, 04, 30; Character files for Lumina Maelstorm; Memory bank

## Family Structure Clarifications
- **Birth Order Confirmed**: Karol-Elf (eldest daughter), Elfina (youngest daughter)
- **No Betrayal**: Karol-Elf has NOT betrayed the family - she works for Lady Vaelora but her loyalties are conflicted, not treasonous
- **Timeline Fixed**: D7 now correctly describes "conflicted position" rather than "betrayal"

## Lareth's Death Timing
- **D14 Death Confirmed**: Lareth dies during the final battle climax (one day before story end)
- **Narrative Purpose**: His sacrifice provides emotional weight to the victory and demonstrates ultimate heroism
- **Updated Description**: Added context explaining this timing is intentional for maximum dramatic impact

## Tengus Setup Enhancement
- **Background Context Added**: Timeline now includes "Years Prior" section showing his long-term planning
- **Character File Enhanced**: Added detailed section on his decades of preparation and strategic positioning
- **Asset Positioning**: Clarified how he used multiple factions as unwitting tools

## Character File Organization
- **NPCs Folder Removed**: All character files consolidated in main `Book 1/04 Characters/` folder
- **Duplicates Eliminated**: Kept most complete versions of character files
- **Structure Cleaned**: Single location for all character information

## Consistency Verification
- ✅ Name standardization (Elfina throughout)
- ✅ Birth order clarity (Karol-Elf eldest, Elfina youngest)  
- ✅ Family loyalty status (conflicted, not betrayed)
- ✅ Timeline emotional arc (Lareth's heroic sacrifice timing)
- ✅ Antagonist motivation setup (Tengus long-term planning)

All major continuity issues identified have been resolved across scenes, character files, timeline, and supporting documents.
