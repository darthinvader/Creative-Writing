# Winterholme

**Overview**: The town surrounding [[Winter University]], built in a carefully planned pattern that serves both practical and protective purposes.

## Geographic Features
- **Carved Harbor**: Harbor carved from solid rock by ancient magical means that modern techniques cannot replicate
- **Terraced Layout**: Town spreads in terraced levels below the University's elevated position
- **Natural Confluence Point**: Market square positioned at what appears to be a confluence of magical energy streams
- **Underground Systems**: Extensive underground water systems that enhance scrying and ward networks

## Architecture & Planning
- **Curved Roads**: Main roads curve around certain areas rather than cutting straight through, avoiding underground void spaces
- **Avoided Areas**: Certain zones where children are told not to play, though the original reasons are forgotten
- **Guardian Design**: Entire settlement pattern planned around geographic and magical features that predate human habitation

## Community Purpose
- **Surface Function**: Fishing village and trade center serving the University
- **Hidden Purpose**: Guardian community that has forgotten its original mission but still unconsciously fulfills it
- **Protective Role**: Maintains and protects whatever was sealed beneath the area during ancient times

## Notable Locations
- **Harbor District**: Carved from solid rock, serves fishing and limited trade
- **Market Square**: Central gathering point at magical confluence
- **Residential Areas**: Follow ancient paths that avoid certain underground structures
- **University Approach**: Winding path up to the elevated University complex

## Underground Features
- **Void Spaces**: Areas beneath the town that are avoided during construction
- **Ancient Structures**: Older constructions that modern buildings were designed to contain and monitor
- **Water Systems**: Underground channels that serve both practical and magical purposes
- **Sealed Areas**: Spaces that are protected but whose original purpose is largely forgotten

## Population & Culture
- **Fishing Community**: Primary industry focused on harbor-based fishing
- **University Support**: Many residents provide services to the academic institution
- **Traditional Patterns**: Community maintains traditional behaviors without remembering their protective significance
- **Unconscious Guardianship**: Residents unknowingly participate in maintaining ancient protections

## Political Context
- **University Relationship**: Exists primarily to support and protect the University
- **Regional Integration**: Part of [[Codaria]]'s broader political structure
- **Strategic Importance**: Location serves as buffer and support for academic research

## Magical Significance
- **Energy Confluence**: Natural meeting point of magical currents
- **Ward Networks**: Underground systems that enhance protective magic
- **Ancient Protections**: Site of magical workings that predate modern understanding
- **Forgotten Purpose**: Original guardian function lost to time but still maintained through tradition

## Timeline Significance
- **Pre-History**: Built around ancient magical structures and energy patterns
- **University Era**: Developed to support the academic institution
- **Current Crisis**: Becomes important during the [[Siege at Coldreach]] and subsequent events
