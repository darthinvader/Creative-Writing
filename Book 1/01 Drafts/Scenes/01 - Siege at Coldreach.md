# 01 — Siege at Coldreach

Goal: Deliver a plea for aid and be believed.
Conflict: A sudden siege, skepticism, and wards failing in a way only she recognizes.
Turn: The city’s north-wall sigils fail in a way she has seen before.
Outcome: Coldreach falters; an organized retreat toward [[Winter University]] begins.

Snow hissed sideways off the fjord, needling Samantha’s cheeks as the bells of Coldreach changed from warning to war. She had not meant to come to the walls—only to the council hall with a sealed petition, an introduction letter, and the prayer she had rehearsed to sound less like prayer. But crowds flowed up the switchback streets with bundles and buckets, and a guard with a crooked braid had pointed and said, “If you’re a caster, we’ll need everyone.”

“I’m an acolyte,” she’d said. “I can steady wards.” The lie was smaller than the truth. She could read their bruises.

From the parapet the sea looked like hammered iron. Sellswords moved in the snow like a spill of pepper, their shields proofed with tar and ice. Some wore onyx sea-drake pins—the mark of [[Serathis|Serathis (Eastern Realm)]]. Siege ladders bucked in the gusts. At intervals the towers—a pair of makeshift, sled-mounted things—lurched forward, then sideways as crews fought the wind.

A man in a heavy gray cloak had both hands pressed to a breach plug of pale stones. His breath steamed; shards of frozen mortar glittered in his beard. “Two inches more,” he called, “and I promise I will stop making them heavier than they already are.”

Someone on the line snorted. Samantha only realized after a second that the stones were the wall. The plug had not been there a moment ago. The man—[[Melf Maelstorm]]?—touched each block like a musician tuning strings, and their grain shifted under his fingers. The old mortar creaked, then knit with a ripple like frost taking a window.

He glanced along the parapet, caught Samantha watching, and raised his eyebrows as if to ask whether she planned to faint. “Don’t,” he said lightly. “We’re very short on fainting space.”

“I won’t,” she said. “But your anchors on the third seam are pulling heat from the sigils.”

“Are they?” He pressed two fingertips to the seam and hissed softly, amused, as if the wall had told him a joke. “Well, that’s rude of them.” He cupped his hand; the stone brightened as if a coal were buried inside it. “Better?”

“Better,” she said, though the discomfort running under the wall was not heat. It was thirst.

A roar tore the air. Fire unfurled in a measured sheet from the tower’s base, wind-sheared but steady, and the nearest ladder simply wasn’t there any longer. The tower shuddered back. Along the inner path of the parapet a second man strode as if the wind were an argument he had already won. He lifted a hand without flourish and pointed. A clean line of flame walked the snow between the ladders and lay there like a border.

[[Lareth Lakhart]] did not shout. He did not pose. He observed, adjusted, and burned only what must burn.

Samantha anchored her satchel with her knee and began to check the ward-staves braced at intervals along the stone. Each had a base rune to catch the wind and a spiral of sigils to bind it into the wall’s lattice. She had been taught the families of signs the way other children learned their letters; to her they read like breath and pulse. These read…thin. Sapped. Like bruises left by hands that never closed.

Down the line, Melf laughed once—short, bright—as a gust tried to steal his hat and he palmed it back onto his head without touching it. “If you fall,” he told a nervous student, “fall inside the wall. It’s warmer there.”

“Professor,” the student said, “is it true they brought alchemists?”

“If they did, they wasted their coin.” Melf winked at Samantha as if inviting her to improve on the line. She demurred with a small, rueful smile. There was no coin in what had taken these wards; and no alchemist.

The first ward-stave failed at the north curve. Samantha felt it before it showed—an emptiness like a lung refusing air. She was moving before she had chosen to, shouldering past a bowman whose fingers were blue to the second knuckle. “Excuse me,” she said, and set her palm to the stave’s spiral, refusing the old, horned thought that tried to name the shape of that hunger.

Prayer rose like breath fog. Not aloud. Never aloud, not here. She listened instead: to the lattice under the stone, to the way the spiral should have caught on it like a stitch. The stitch had been cut and the thread pulled. The rune-wood was pale as bone where it should have glowed with a banked ember.

She whispered the smallest of her rites, the kind that steadied candles in drafty chapels. The stave brightened. For a heartbeat it seemed eager. Then the light guttered not outward but inward, as if a throat had swallowed it.

Her breath hitched. She had seen this too many times. Not here. Not this far from home.

“Problem?” Melf said, arriving in a swirl of cold and the smell of wet wool. His eyes did not miss the way her hand trembled or how she kept it there anyway, refusing to lift it from the stave.

"Something is drinking the bind," she said.

He didn’t laugh then. His gaze sharpened as if refocusing to see a finer grain. “Lareth!” he called—not loud, but the name carried. “Pause the embroidery and tell me if this tastes wrong.”

Lareth came at a measured trot, the border of his last fire-line beginning to steam away. He put two fingers to the stave the way a physician takes a pulse. His jaw went still. “That’s not alchemy,” he said.

“No,” Samantha said. “It isn’t.” She met his eyes. The wind shoved hard along the wall, and for a moment the three of them leaned together simply to stand.

“What is it,” Melf asked, very mild, “and how angry should I be about it?”

 She could have given them theology. She could have traced names and counter-names, old quarrels between powers that had outlived maps. She gave them the observable instead. “In the south, we saw rites open like a throat. They drink prayer and ward both. They hide inside things that look like ours.”

“Like our sigils,” Lareth said.

“Yes.”

He nodded once. “Then we do not feed it.” He looked to Melf. “Can you bridge without the staves if I keep their ladders busy?”

Melf flexed his fingers as if they were cold, though she suspected they were not. “I can give the wall a denser grain and ask it politely not to fall. It might listen if we don’t shout.” He glanced at Samantha. “And if someone more devout than me persuades the lattice that we are not, in fact, its enemy.”

“I can try,” she said. She was already mapping the stitchwork in her head, the places where the wall’s pattern touched the city’s civic sigils, the hearth-wards, the salt runes chalked at doorways.

The next assault came quick: grapnels, hooks, a knot of men under mantlets who ran as if the storm had taught them. Lareth’s fire met them not with a wave but with threadbare bursts that melted iron rings and set wet leather smoking. He was rationing heat. Clever. Someone below would be counting how much the University could throw.

“Shoelaces,” Melf murmured. Samantha blinked at him. “I tie them,” he said, voice absent, hands spread toward the wall where hairline fractures sang to his touch. “The world’s shoelaces. To each other, when needed.”

He did something with the stone that she felt more than saw—redirecting stress, knotting faults together instead of letting them run. The plug settled. Somewhere a ladder cracked and spilled three men into the drift.

“Don’t look,” Lareth said to the student as calmly as if advising a tea steep. “Mind your breath. Count to four on draw and release.” He loosed a narrow lance of fire that clipped a grapnel rope and stitched a new line before the old had fallen.

The north stave went dead. Samantha tasted the absence like iron. She did not pray then. She set her second hand to the spiral and thought of home—the smell of birch pitch on boats pulled for winter, the polished stone of the altar worn by thumb after thumb, the taste of salt when the first storm hits and you do not flinch. She dug the rite in like a tack. When the light tried to run, she jinked it sideways into the lattice rather than along it, giving the throat nothing straight to swallow.

The stave held. Dim, but held.

“Thank you,” Melf said, and for once there was no joke in it.

The assault on their stretch broke at last when the sled-tower pitched and a wheel—hastily nailed on and badly—sheared its spokes. Lareth didn’t burn the men who jumped. He burned the ice beneath their feet so they couldn’t run well and left the rest to archers who had gotten their color back in their fingers.

Relief lasted three breaths. From the West Gate came a sound like stone coughing itself apart. A long, low horn rolled over the city—not the warning note, the withdrawal. The bells followed in a measured sequence, calling districts by order toward the inner ways.

Samantha realized her palm hurt as if she had held a hot cup too long. She lifted it from the stave and pressed it to the wool at her chest until the sting faded.

“We’ll need to speak where no one is listening,” Lareth said, eyes on the wall where sigils had gone ashy as if from smoke.

Melf rolled his shoulders and the wall answered by settling another fraction. “University then,” he said. “I’ll file the paperwork later about how I definitely did not do anything the triad needs to scold me for.”

Samantha swallowed a laugh that came out shaky anyway. “You didn’t,” she said.

“Not yet,” he said, and finally allowed himself a small, tired grin. “We’ll save the scolding for when it’s fun.”

They left the parapet to those who knew how to clean and count. Snow had already begun covering footprints. Samantha looked back once. The north curve of the wall was darker than the rest, as if a shadow had taken root there. Not a mark. A hunger.

 She did not speak any older names than this. Names feed things.
She would not even think the horned name that pressed at the edge of memory.

“Winter University,” Lareth said, as if it were a direction and not a place. Samantha nodded, hugged her satchel close, and followed them down.
