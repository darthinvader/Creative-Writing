# Coldreach

- Summary: Frontier port district of [[Winterholme]] on the fjord edge of [[Codaria]]; frequent storms, resilient docks, and outer defensive walls reinforced by University designs.
- Reputation: Tough, communal, skeptical until convinced.

## Districts & Features
- North Wall — site of the opening siege and ward-stave anomalies; North Bend particularly vulnerable to assault.
- West Gate — breached during the siege, forcing organized retreat to inner city.
- Harbor Quarter — ice-scarred pilings; winter fleets pulled to sheds.
- Outer Defenses — first line of defense for [[Winterholme]] proper.

## Security & Wards
- Civic sigils tied to hearth-wards; University-standard ward-staves along parapets that can be fouled by alchemical chaff (salted ash and iron grit).
- Recent Issue: "Bleeding" wards consistent with magic-drain patterns; staves require cleaning and counter-marking to restore function.
- North Bend: Vulnerable section where wind cuts worst, susceptible to ladder assaults.

## Current Events
- Under siege by foreign sellswords covertly funded by [[Serathis|Serathis (Eastern Realm)]].
- Sellswords wear onyx sea-drake pins; West Gate breach forced an organized retreat to [[Winterholme]]'s inner defenses and [[Winter University]]. See [[Timeline#Y1 M1 D1 — West Gate breach; withdrawal horn and bells call districts to inner ways; organized retreat toward Winter University. See Coldreach.]].
