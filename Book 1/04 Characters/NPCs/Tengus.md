# Tengus

- Summary: A relatively young but extraordinarily powerful dark elf sorcerer (~100) seeking the [[Book of Gosh]] and [[Sword of Gosh]] for personal power. Works alone as an independent agent, using other factions as tools and cover. His power level exceeds that of typical mages—making direct confrontation nearly impossible.

## Motivation
- Seeks to complete the fallen angel's interrupted working using the paired artifacts
- Desires to open permanent gates between realms and wield divine authority without mortal restrictions
- Has spent decades planning and positioning himself for this opportunity
- Works alone, not affiliated with any known faction—considers them all beneath his ambition
- Views [[Lady Vaelora Serath]] and Serathis as useful tools but lacking true vision

## Abilities
- **Exceptional Magical Power**: Far beyond normal sorcerer capabilities—overpowered compared to University faculty
- **Shadow Mastery**: Expert in stealth, misdirection, and concealment magic
- **Structural Manipulation**: Can weaken building supports and create catastrophic failure points
- **Long-term Planning**: Decades of preparation, positioning, and resource gathering
- **Magical Compulsion**: Can control and manipulate other agents as tools
- **Counter-Scouting**: Skilled at avoiding detection while gathering intelligence

## Methods
- **Phase 1 - Infiltration**: Used Serathis agents as cover while working on the sealed chambers
- **Phase 2 - Manipulation**: Let Serathis believe they hired him while pursuing his own goals
- **Phase 3 - Ultimatum**: Issues 3-day warning before beginning his "true working"
- **Leverage**: Threatens to collapse entire University and town if opposed immediately
- **Strategic Patience**: Willing to wait decades and abandon current work if necessary

## Relationships
- **Tools**: Serathis agents (they think they hired him, he uses them as cover)
- **Target**: [[Samantha Seraphel]] (needed for divine resonance in his working)
- **Rival**: [[Lady Vaelora Serath]] (he considers her "lacking vision")
- **Threat**: [[Administrator]] (will kill her in magical battle during his return)

## Hooks & Resources
- May possess or trade critical pages from the [[Book of Gosh]]
- Has access to forbidden knowledge about the artifacts' true capabilities
- Commands resources sufficient to threaten an entire university
- Understands the connection between the artifacts and Baramoth's incursion potential

## Threat Level
- **Magic**: Overpowered—direct magical confrontation inadvisable
- **Resources**: Significant—can threaten large groups simultaneously
- **Knowledge**: Extensive—knows more about the artifacts than most
- **Ruthlessness**: Absolute—will kill without hesitation if defied

## Fate
- Dies by the hand of [[Samantha Seraphel]] after precipitating the Baramoth incursion
- His pursuit of the artifacts ultimately leads to his own destruction

## Current Arc
- **Scene 03-04**: Begins covert investigation of [[Winter University]]
- **Scene 04+**: Escalates to direct confrontation and ultimatums
- **Future**: Forces the protagonists into impossible choices about the artifacts
