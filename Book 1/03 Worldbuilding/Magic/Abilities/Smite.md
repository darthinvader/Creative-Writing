# Smite

## Description
Smite is a divine or channeled magical ability that temporarily empowers physical strikes with supernatural force. It manifests as visible light that runs along the practitioner's limbs during activation.

## Mechanics
- **Activation Word**: "Valamar" (observed incantation)
- **Visual Manifestation**: Light runs up the practitioner's arm "like a bell-note made visible"
- **Physical Enhancement**: Adds supernatural force to physical strikes
- **Precise Control**: Can be constrained and measured rather than explosive
- **Resource Cost**: Draws from practitioner's internal reserves, leaving them feeling "hollow"

## Physical Experience
### During Activation
- Expansion sensation in the chest, pressing against ribs
- Prickling skin, hair standing on end
- Described as "ecstasy and agony combined"
- Power burning channels through flesh "never meant to hold it"

### After Use
- Hollowing sensation as power fades
- Temporary weakness or emptiness
- Requires conscious restraint to avoid overuse

## Combat Applications
### Observed Effects ([[01 - Siege at Coldreach]])
- **Enhanced Strike Force**: Blow "driven back as if the air itself had weight and wrath"
- **Measured Impact**: "Clean, constrained blow" rather than uncontrolled burst
- **Tactical Use**: Single decisive strike rather than continuous enhancement
- **Results**: Capable of caving in sternum, decisive elimination of threats

## Tactical Considerations
- **Conservation**: Practitioners must "save it, hoarding it like a last swallow of water"
- **Timing**: Most effective when used sparingly at critical moments
- **Control**: Requires discipline to avoid "chasing" the empowerment sensation
- **Efficiency**: More effective than multiple unenhanced attacks

## Training and Philosophy
- Appears to require both physical combat training and magical channeling ability
- Emphasizes restraint and precision over raw power
- May have divine or spiritual component (suggested by incantation)
- Compatible with disciplined combat styles

## Recognition by Others
- Immediately identified by experienced magical practitioners
- Described as "useful" by [[Melf Maelstorm]]
- Recognized for its "measured" nature by [[Lareth Lakhart]]

## Limitations
- Cannot be used continuously without severe cost
- Requires conscious activation and control
- Limited by practitioner's internal reserves
- Risk of overuse and consequent weakness
