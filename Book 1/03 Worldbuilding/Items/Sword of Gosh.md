# Sword of Gosh

- Origin: Forged for the fallen angel Gosh; paired with the [[Book of Gosh]].
- Appearance: Pale metal with a dim inner sheen; inscriptions masked by soot-like tarnish.
- Lore: Said to answer only to the bearer who knows the true charge of Gosh; purification possible only through [[Samantha Seraphel]].

## Powers (Unpurified)
- Edge that parts wards as if they’re cloth.
- Resonance with seals; agitates nearby corrupted sigils.

## Curse
- Attempts to open a demon gate when invoked at full power; seeks [[Baramoth (Demon God)]], unleashing minotaur demons as shock-troops.
- Corruptive Whispers: Urges ends-justify-means bargains.

## Costs & Limits
- Draws vitality; repeated use worsens local corruption.
- Cannot be fully controlled without the Book’s counter-rites.

## Purification
- Requires a paladin-herald bearing aligned oaths ([[Samantha Seraphel]]), a counter-rite from the [[Book of Gosh]], and a sanctified locus.
- On success: Gate-opening is severed; edge retains ward-parting without fueling corruption.

## Current Status
- Rumored resurfaced on Codaria; contested by East, West, and the Paladin King’s agents. A failed attempt by the Paladin King to wield it unpurified precipitated Baramoth’s incursion and the destruction of his city.
