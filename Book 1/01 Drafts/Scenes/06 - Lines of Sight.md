Lareth stood in the pre-dawn darkness of his office, palms pressed flat against the massive oak desk that had served as his command center for seventeen years of academic life. The wood grain beneath his fingertips spoke of countless hours spent grading papers, writing recommendations, and solving the endless small crises that defined university administration. Normal problems. Manageable problems.

Problems that didn't involve ancient demons waiting in the basement.

Through the tall windows overlooking the University's central courtyard, he could see the first hints of gray touching the horizon—the second dawn since Tengus had issued his ultimatum. Two days remaining before a creature of impossible power returned to claim artifacts that could remake reality itself. Two days to prepare defenses against someone who had overpowered their combined magical assault as easily as swatting flies.

He activated his lattice sight with the careful precision that had kept him alive through seven years of military campaigns in Florian. The familiar shift in perception washed over him like stepping from a candlelit room into blazing sunlight—mundane reality overlaid with flowing rivers of magical energy that revealed the University's true architecture.

Every ward anchor glowed with distinctive signatures, their protective weaves forming a three-dimensional network that extended through walls, floors, and foundations like luminous spider silk. The defensive arrays his predecessors had built over generations painted themselves in shimmering blues and silvers, beautiful and complex and utterly inadequate for what was coming.

Through lattice sight, Tengus's brief presence had left scars on the magical infrastructure—dark spots where power had pressed against protective weaves with casual force, testing their strength with the methodical patience of someone who had spent decades learning the University's vulnerabilities. The darkness lingered like burns, marking each point where their enemy had probed for weaknesses they couldn't afford to have.

Lareth moved through his morning routine with military precision, each action serving multiple purposes. Water heated in the copper kettle while he reviewed defensive positions mapped on architectural drawings spread across his desk. Strong black tea steeped while he traced ward patterns with his finger, his lattice sight revealing how the protective networks connected through the building's structure. Bread toasted over a small flame while he calculated magical capacities and resource requirements for sustained siege conditions.

The routine provided structure for thinking through tactical problems that had no clean solutions. How do you defend a position when your enemy possesses overwhelming force? How do you protect something that might be more dangerous than the person trying to steal it? How do you prepare for a confrontation when failure could trigger the apocalypse?

A soft knock interrupted his planning. "Lareth?" Samantha's voice carried the careful politeness of someone who understood the weight of interrupting strategic preparation. "May I come in?"

"Please," he replied, gesturing toward the chair across from his desk while maintaining his focus on the architectural drawings. Through his enhanced perception, he could see the divine radiance that surrounded her like a second skin—holy energy that responded to spiritual corruption with protective warmth. Whatever Samantha truly was, her presence made the University's wards resonate with harmonious frequencies that spoke of shared purpose.

She settled into the chair with the controlled grace of someone trained for violence who had learned to move through civilized spaces without alarming anyone. Her blessed armor caught the early morning light filtering through his windows, mail rings gleaming with silver radiance that his lattice sight revealed as something more complex than mere metal—divine craftsmanship that existed partially in realms beyond normal perception.

"I wanted to discuss our defensive preparations," Samantha said, her diplomatic training evident in the way she framed collaboration as consultation rather than interference. "And to understand what you're seeing with your... enhanced sight, was it? Melf mentioned you can perceive magical structures directly."

Lareth gestured toward the architectural drawings spread across his desk, then activated a minor illumination spell that highlighted specific areas with gentle golden light. "Lattice sight reveals the flow of magical energy through structures and living beings. Every ward, every spell, every magical artifact appears as patterns of light and color that show their function and relative strength."

He traced one finger along the detailed floor plan of the University's eastern wing, where protective arrays formed dense networks around sensitive areas. "What I see when I look at our defenses is a system designed to handle normal threats—rival institutions trying to steal research, occasional monsters wandering in from the wilderness, political conflicts that might spill over into academic territory. Competent work, but not sufficient for what's coming."

Through his lattice sight, the sealed chamber beneath the Administrator's office appeared as a void surrounded by wards that pulsed with desperate intensity. The protective weaves around that space glowed with signatures he had never encountered in seven years of military service—ancient magic that predated the University's construction, power that belonged to no tradition taught in modern curricula.

"Tengus tested our defenses during his visit," Lareth continued, his voice carrying the controlled tension of someone reporting tactical intelligence. "His power pressed against ward anchors throughout the building, probing for structural weaknesses with the patience of someone who has spent decades learning our vulnerabilities. What I saw... he wasn't trying to break through our protections. He was mapping them."

Samantha leaned forward, her tactical training recognizing the implications of reconnaissance disguised as confrontation. "He already knows how to bypass our defenses when he returns."

"Worse than that," Lareth replied grimly, his finger moving to trace the chamber's outline on the architectural drawing. "When I focus lattice sight on the sealed area beneath the Administrator's office, I can see power signatures that make no sense. The wards aren't just containing something dangerous—they're trying to muffle something that shouldn't exist in any rational universe."

The door opened again, and Melf appeared carrying a tray with three steaming cups and a plate of morning pastries. His many-layered cape rustled softly as he moved, pockets clinking with the sound of alchemical components and crystalline reagents organized with scholarly precision. Despite the early hour, his eyes held the bright alertness of someone who had spent the night communing with forces beyond normal perception.

"Good morning," Melf said, settling the tray on a clear section of Lareth's desk before taking the remaining chair. Through lattice sight, Lareth could see the enhanced magical connections that linked his old friend to the University's foundations—streams of energy that flowed between Melf's consciousness and the building's stone bones, creating a communication network that revealed everything from structural integrity to emotional resonance.

"How are the stones this morning?" Lareth asked, accepting one of the cups with grateful recognition of Melf's consideration. The tea blend carried hints of mountain herbs and dried fruits—comfort flavors that reminded him of morning briefings during the Florian campaigns, when simple pleasures provided anchors of normalcy in the midst of strategic chaos.

"Nervous," Melf replied, his expression showing the weight of information gathered through supernatural communion. "The foundations remember everything that's ever touched them, and last night they whispered about the sealed chamber in ways that made my skin crawl. Whatever's down there has been waiting for decades, and it knows we're preparing to disturb its patience."

Samantha cupped her hands around her tea, steam rising to frame her face as she processed the implications of magical intelligence gathering that exceeded anything in her Herald training. "You're both seeing aspects of this threat that normal senses can't perceive. What does that tell us about our chances if we have to face it directly?"

Lareth set down his cup and moved to the window, his lattice sight automatically cataloguing the defensive positions visible in the courtyard below. Early morning routines continued with reassuring normalcy—students hurrying between buildings with arms full of books, faculty members engaged in animated discussions about theoretical problems, groundskeepers tending gardens that provided both beauty and alchemical components for University research.

The scene painted pictures of academic life continuing with comfortable predictability, unaware that their institutional home sat atop something that could end civilization if released improperly.

"Military doctrine teaches that when facing overwhelming force, you don't meet the enemy head-on," Lareth said, his voice carrying the measured cadence of someone translating combat experience into academic language. "You change the nature of the engagement. Force them to fight on terms that favor your capabilities rather than theirs."

He turned back to face his companions, his expression showing the tactical planning that had kept him alive through campaigns where retreat wasn't an option. "Tengus expects us to either attempt a direct magical confrontation—which we'll lose—or try to prevent him from accessing the chamber at all. Both approaches play to his strengths."

"What's the alternative?" Samantha asked, her diplomatic training recognizing the setup for strategic thinking that operated outside conventional parameters.

"We let him in," Lareth replied quietly, his lattice sight revealing the chamber's defenses with crystalline clarity. "But we ensure that when he faces whatever's waiting below, he's dealing with something we've prepared rather than something he expects."

Through his enhanced perception, the sealed chamber's wards pulsed with rhythms that suggested not just containment, but active monitoring. The magical signatures around that space spoke of decades of careful observation, protective weaves that had been modified and strengthened by someone who understood exactly what they were guarding against.

Melf leaned back in his chair, his scholarly mind clearly working through implications that extended beyond immediate tactical concerns. "The Administrator mentioned that the guardian below isn't just protecting the Book of Gosh—it's waiting for someone worthy to end its imprisonment by destroying what it was bound to protect. If we can influence the nature of that test..."

"We turn Tengus's knowledge against him," Samantha finished, her tactical training recognizing the elegance of using an enemy's strength as the foundation for their downfall. "He knows how to access the chamber, but he doesn't know what criteria determine worthiness."

Lareth moved back to his desk, his finger tracing the chamber's outline on the architectural drawings while lattice sight revealed the complex magical structures that surrounded it. "The wards aren't just defensive. They're evaluative. Whatever's down there has been designed to judge the worthiness of anyone who claims the artifacts."

Through his enhanced perception, he could see how the protective weaves around the chamber formed patterns that resembled testing arrays—magical structures designed to measure spiritual purity, divine authority, and moral worthiness rather than raw power. The signatures spoke of ancient craftsmanship that operated according to principles deeper than academic magic.

"Which means our preparation isn't about strengthening defenses," Lareth continued, his voice gaining confidence as tactical planning aligned with magical reality. "It's about ensuring that when the test comes, we understand its nature well enough to help the right person pass."

He looked directly at Samantha, lattice sight revealing the divine radiance that surrounded her like a second skin. Whatever she truly was, her spiritual signature resonated with frequencies that belonged to no mortal tradition—authority that might be sufficient for trials designed to evaluate worthiness rather than power.

"The question becomes: are you prepared to face something that was designed to judge whether you deserve divine authority, or whether you'll be found wanting and destroyed in the process?"

Through his lattice sight, Lareth could see how Samantha's divine energy responded to the challenge—not with fear or uncertainty, but with the steady radiance of someone who had spent her life in service to purposes larger than personal ambition. Whatever trials waited in the darkness below, her spiritual signature suggested someone who had already passed tests of worthiness that most people never faced.

Melf reached into one of his cape's many pockets, withdrawing a piece of parchment covered with intricate diagrams and careful notations. "I've been researching what little information exists about Gosh's final working. The fallen angel's artifacts weren't just tools for opening gates between realms—they were designed to test whether anyone who claimed them possessed the spiritual authority to use divine power responsibly."

He spread the parchment on Lareth's desk, revealing architectural drawings that showed the chamber's original construction alongside theoretical diagrams of magical testing arrays. "The undead dragon isn't just a guardian. It's an examiner. Something bound to evaluate whether anyone who seeks the artifacts deserves them or should be destroyed for presumption."

Lareth studied the diagrams through lattice sight, watching how the magical signatures aligned with architectural features that had been hidden for decades. The chamber had been designed as more than a vault—it was a courtroom where divine authority itself would serve as judge and jury.

"Then our preparation involves more than defensive planning," Samantha said, her voice carrying the weight of someone accepting responsibility that could reshape everything she thought she knew about her own purpose. "We need to understand exactly what this test measures and how to ensure I'm ready for judgment by something that knew divine power firsthand."

Through the window, the sun cleared the horizon, painting the University's stone walls with golden light that spoke of another day beginning in their countdown toward confrontation. Two days remaining before Tengus returned to claim artifacts that could remake reality itself.

Two days to prepare someone who might be their only hope to face a test designed by forces that predated human civilization.

Lareth looked at his companions—a Herald whose divine heritage remained hidden even from herself, a scholar whose communion with stone revealed secrets that spanned generations, and his own tactical expertise honed through campaigns where failure meant watching everything he protected burn.

For the first time since Tengus had issued his ultimatum, Lareth felt something that might have been optimism. Not because their chances had improved, but because he finally understood the nature of the battle they were preparing to fight.

Not a contest of raw power, but a test of worthiness that played to strengths his enemies didn't possess.

"We have work to do," he said quietly, his lattice sight revealing how the University's wards resonated with renewed purpose. "And not much time to do it."
