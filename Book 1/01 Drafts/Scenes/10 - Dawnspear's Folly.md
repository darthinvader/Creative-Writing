# 10 — Dawnspear's Folly

Goal: The Paladin King claims divine right to wield the Sword.
Conflict: The sword is unpurified; warnings are ignored.
Turn: Catastrophic backfire opens a gate; minotaur demons pour through.
Outcome: City destroyed; the King dies; trio escapes with crucial clues.

Notes: Keep POV tight and brief; avoid gore; emphasize hubris, cost, and the sword’s danger.
