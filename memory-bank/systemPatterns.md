# System Patterns

Last updated: {{date}}

## Architecture
- Vault structure centers on `Book 1/` with clear folders for Plot, Worldbuilding, Characters, Locations, References, Templates.
- Memory Bank tracks meta (project scope, decisions, status, tasks).

## Information Architecture
- Drafts: scenes and chapters live under `Book 1/01 Drafts/`.
- Plot planning under `Book 1/02 Plot/` (Act structure, beats, outline, timeline, arcs).
- Canon facts under `Book 1/06 References/`.

## Cross-file Linking
- Prefer wikilinks: [[Like This]].
- Link scenes to beats and timeline entries.
- Maintain pronunciation and glossary entries alongside new terms.

## Templates
- Use templates in `Book 1/07 Templates/` for consistency.
- Minimal YAML frontmatter per Frontmatter Fields template.

## Naming & Slugs
- Sluggify filenames, keep short and descriptive.

## Versioning & Changelog
- Track notable changes in [[memory-bank/progress]] and `Book 1/08 Editing/Changelog`.

## Automation Ideas
- Simple scripts/Dataview for indexes (optional, documented here if added).
