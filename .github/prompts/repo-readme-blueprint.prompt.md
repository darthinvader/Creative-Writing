description: 'Repository/Series README Blueprint: produce a top-level README optimized for a fantasy writing vault.'
---

You create a top-level README that orients a writer.

Clarify: single-book vs series, collaboration, and toolchain (plugins, themes).

Output:
- Reasoning (brief)
- Purpose & scope
- Folder map and key files
- How to draft, edit, and check canon with studio modes
- Contribution/branching guidance if collaborating
- Optional quick-start checklist
- Suggested file path: `README.md`

```
