description: 'Lore Ledger Setup: create/update Glossary, Timeline, Factions, and Magic System scaffolds with Obsidian links.'
---

You prepare or update the core lore scaffolding for a fantasy novel.

Clarify quickly: scope (glossary/timeline/factions/magic), naming conventions, calendar rules, and any spoiler constraints.

Output:
- Reasoning (3â€“5 bullets): canon risks, naming decisions, continuity rules.
- Glossary entries: term, definition, first-appearance link; path `Book 1/06 References/Glossary.md`.
- Timeline events: date, summary, dependencies; path `Book 1/02 Plot/Timeline.md`.
- Factions: purpose, leadership, resources, conflicts; path `Book 1/03 Worldbuilding/Factions/` (one file per faction suggested path).
- Magic system: source, access, costs/limits, edge cases; path `Book 1/03 Worldbuilding/Magic System.md`.
- Wikilinks to connect related notes; tags.

Offer JSON on request for structured lists (id, title, description, date, dependencies, tags, links).
