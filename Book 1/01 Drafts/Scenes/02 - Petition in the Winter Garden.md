# 02 — Petition in the Winter Garden

Goal: Secure a hearing for her petition by proving herself useful in the immediate crisis.
Conflict: University resources stretched to breaking; official policy blocks external petitions during wartime; her credibility as an outsider questioned.
Turn: Samantha demonstrates her alchemical knowledge and practical skill in the Green Crucible, earning a narrow foothold.
Outcome: Formal petition denied but redirected to practical service; earns five minutes with the triad after proving herself through work.

The bells had stopped naming streets for retreat and started naming work. Each bronze voice found its purpose in the University's rhythm—first bell for runners, second for shifts, third for the census of what remained. Two hours had passed since the last sellsword fell from Coldreach's walls, and Samantha's chest still burned from the climb up narrow stairs that reeked of wet wool and fear-sweat. Her satchel bounced against her hip with each step, the buckles singing against leather stiff with frost. She had come to speak. Now she followed two men whose silence felt like locked doors.

Snow whispered against her face—not the cutting sleet of the siege but fat, lazy flakes that melted on her lashes and left salt-tracks down her cheeks. Her stomach knotted around the hollow ache of too little food and too much dread. The first clean breath in hours hit her lungs sharp as broken glass, tasting of winter instead of smoke.

*What if they won't listen? What if they can't help? Valamar grant me wisdom to serve where I stand, regardless of their answer.*

Winter University's garden opened before them—ordered beds cut from black basalt, gravel paths where ice crystals caught the light. Glasshouses lined the inner wall like giant ribs, breathing fog into the cold air.

A row of copper glyph-arches traced the central path, their sigils pulsing with honey-colored light. Water ran beneath them without freezing, and the warmth reached her face when she passed near. Steam met sleet at ankle height, carrying scents of rich peat and sharp vinegar.

Beyond the hedges, a glass hive slept in the pale light. Through the transparent walls she could see bees clotted in amber clusters, their wings folded in perfect stillness. The combs glowed with a faint luminescence where tiny runes kept them just above death's drowse.

"This way," Lareth said, his voice cutting paths through her wonder as surely as his footsteps cut tracks in the gravel. Each word crisp as the air, each syllable a decision made and acted upon. Ice cracked beneath his boots with sounds like breaking glass.

He led them along a cinder path between beds where small black stakes bore chalk marks—symbols that would mean nothing to most and everything to the initiated. Samantha studied them as she walked, recognizing the grammar of practical magic. *Ward markers. Harvest dates. Growth cycles.*

A gate-warden in a blue sash stepped from an archway that smelled of old stone and wet mortar. "Faculty and students only under Redline Three," she said, breath smoking in silver plumes that dissipated quickly in the cold air. Her voice was professional rather than unkind—the tone of someone who had delivered the same words a hundred times in the past hour. Her eyes took inventory of Samantha's travel-stained satchel, the soot ground into her cuffs like charcoal dust, the small cuts along her knuckles that had scabbed over with dried blood. "Visitors will be billeted in the east lecture hall."

Samantha's hands tightened on her satchel straps. The leather creaked in her grip. *Billeted with the others. Set aside. Forgotten.*

"She's with us," Melf said without slowing, his cape billowing around him in layers of wool and secrets. He nudged a brass lever with the back of his knuckles as he passed—a casual gesture that spoke of long familiarity. Somewhere water changed its mind about direction with a soft *chuck* and a sigh of redirected flow. "And I am about to break three separate procurement rules in the shed, but we're calling it pedagogy."

The warden's mouth considered smiling and decided against it. She stepped aside, boots scraping against stone worn smooth by countless passages. "Professor." A pause, weighted with something that might have been sympathy. "The Administrator is in the herbarium."

"I will go where I must," Samantha said to the warden, because politeness cost nothing and might buy everything. Her voice carried more steadiness than her nerves deserved. "But I came to speak. Not only of Coldreach."

The warden's gaze flicked to Lareth—a question asked without words.

"She will speak," Lareth said, and the promise had edges sharp enough to cut. His tone carried the weight of authority earned through fire and precision. "We'll keep it brief."

They crossed under an arch cut with wave-marks—old stone that remembered when it had been sea floor, millions of years before anyone had learned to read its grain. The memory of salt water seemed to linger in the air, mixing with the scents of growing things and careful chemistry.

In the herbarium cloister, winter light turned to gold through glass panes that sang faintly when the wind caught them just right. Tables held trays of labeled cuttings—each slip of green life tagged with careful script that documented hope and intention. A blackboard dominated one wall, covered in a list of shortfalls written in a hand with no flourishes, no wasted motion: *saltpeter low; copper wire low; glass alembics (thin); juniper cones (green only); alcohol (denatured) down to two casks; vinegar (sour) fine; foxglove leaves to be rationed to infirmary; brimstone safe; binder gum pending.*

Each line was a negation. Each shortage a door closing on possibility.

People moved through the space with the focused intensity of those who knew exactly what mattered and what didn't. A boy barely old enough to shave staggered under a crate of peat blocks that looked heavier than he was, his breath coming in short puffs that spoke of strain held just this side of breaking. A woman with ink stained to her wrists counted glass pipettes into a rack with the rhythm of prayer, her lips moving silently as she sorted by size and condition. Students—identifiable by the cut of their coats and the way their eyes tried to be everywhere at once—ran for the shed where a brazier sighed contentment and a rune-kiln steamed with barely contained intent.

[[Vera Thricebind (Administrator)|Vera]] stood by the blackboard like a monument to efficiency. A half-orc with neat tusks that caught the light when she turned her head, sleeves rolled to reveal forearms marked with old scars from laboratory accidents. Her expression had been carved from stone that didn't care about weather or wishes. When she looked at you, you understood that time was a limited resource and she would not waste it on courtesy.

"Professor. Marshal." She nodded to Melf and Lareth with equal measure—respect without deference, acknowledgment without subservience. Her gaze found Samantha and evaluated without curiosity, without disdain. Simply measured and catalogued. "Report."

"Alchemical chaff in the assault," Lareth said, his words crisp as the air outside. "Salted ash and iron. It fouls our delicate work—wards, catches, triggers. We need a binder wash and chalk that sets through grit. Melf will lead formulation in the Green Crucible."

"Green Crucible is live?" the Administrator asked, chalk dust on her fingers from marking updates.

"Two rune-kilns and an attitude," Melf said, pulling his cape closer around his shoulders. The fabric whispered secrets with each movement. "I'll make them get along."

"Good." She chalked two lines under *binder gum*, the scratch of calcium carbonate on slate like fingernails on stone. Then she stood still long enough to make it clear that she could stand still while others rushed—a display of control more pointed than any words. Only then did she look to Samantha. "And you?"

Samantha's rehearsed words scattered like startled birds. She reached for the simplest truth, the one that didn't require performance or persuasion. "I am Samantha Seraphel," she said, keeping titles to herself. She had tried that approach too often to anything but narrowing eyes and closed doors. "I came to plead a case to the University's spellcasters—those who would choose to hear me. My homeland needs aid." The words felt inadequate, stripped of the formal language she'd practiced, but perhaps plainness would serve where ceremony had failed.

The Administrator listened the way granite listens—fully, without yielding, absorbing without changing. Her stillness was complete, the kind that made you aware of your own fidgeting, your own unnecessary motion. "You will be billeted with the others. We will feed you and keep you warm. We are not accepting external petitions under Redline Three."

The refusal landed like a physical blow, settling in Samantha's chest with the weight of lead. Possible—probable, even—but hearing it spoken aloud made it real in a way that planning couldn't prepare her for. Her hands clenched. Nails bit into palms already tender from the morning's work.

*Think. Don't react. Find another way.*

*Valamar's teachings: when the direct path is barred, serve where you stand. Truth reveals itself through action, not words.*

"I can pay in service," she said, fighting to keep her voice level. "I can work. I can prove what I am, if belief is the price."

"Belief is not the price," the Administrator said, her voice carrying the finality of mathematical law. "Metal and time are the price. Also the safety of students, which costs more than either. We are at war. The University's casters are seconded to the city defense and hospital. When the bells stop naming streets for retreat, we can speak of the outside again."

The refusal was not cruel. That somehow made it heavier. Samantha looked at the blackboard where needs were written in numbers that didn't care about prayers or pleas or the desperation in her voice. *Copper wire low. Alcohol down to two casks. Foxglove leaves to be rationed.* Each line was evidence that her problems were not the only problems, her need not the only need.

She bowed her head because that was the only gesture that didn't waste anyone's time or dignity. The movement sent a strand of hair across her face, still damp with melted snow. "I understand." She looked up, meeting the Administrator's eyes directly. "May I stand where I am useful now?"

The Administrator turned to Melf as if the answer lived with him—not deference but delegation, the efficient distribution of decisions to those best equipped to make them. "What do you need in the Crucible?"

"Hands that don't panic when the coil coughs," Melf said, his voice warm with the promise of shared work. "An eye for seams. Someone who can read chalk like a second language." His eyes found Samantha for a confirming beat—not asking permission but making a small contract of trust. "She does all three."

"Granted," the Administrator said. The word fell with the weight of official sanction. "You will receive a billet and a badge for internal movement. After the countermeasure is stable, you may request five minutes to speak to the triad. No promises beyond five minutes."

Five minutes. It wasn't what she had come for, but it was a foothold on a cliff face that had seemed smooth. "Thank you," Samantha said, and felt something small and fierce unfurl in her chest—not quite hope, but the possibility of hope.

They walked toward the Green Crucible, a long, low hall where working sigils made their own weather. The door exhaled breath that carried the mingled scents of vinegar sharp enough to make her eyes water, brass polish that caught in the back of her throat, damp wool that spoke of long hours and dedicated work, and oranges that had given their skins to someone else's tincture—a ghost of citrus floating over everything else.

Inside, sigil-lines traced the ceiling in geometries that pleased the eye without revealing their purpose to casual observation. Focus rings gleamed along the walls like silver eyes, each one positioned with the precision of a master clockmaker. In the corner, a green-banded crucible sat with the sullen patience of a tool that had opinions about being asked to work again.

The air hummed with potential—not loud, but persistent, like the feeling before a thunderstorm when every hair on your body stands at attention.

"Steady," Lareth said to the room, his voice cutting through nervous chatter without needing volume. The words carried authority earned through competence, respected because it had been tested. "We're being clocked."

"As always," Melf said, rolling his sleeves to his elbows with methodical care. His forearms were strong in the way of people who lifted things more important than themselves—not the bulk of a laborer but the precise strength of a craftsman. "All right. Binder wash. We need something that turns grit into polite paste and slides out of grooves without scratching—basically a gentle solvent to restore fouled [[Ward-staves]]. Juniper resin? Vinegar? A breath of oil so it doesn't seize."

The work demanded breath and steadiness. Samantha felt fatigue at the edges of her consciousness like a blade testing an edge—aware of its presence but not yet cutting deep enough to matter.

"Saltpeter is low," a student called from across the room, consulting a ledger with the careful attention of someone who knew that mistakes had consequences.

"Then we'll not ask it to dance," Melf said, his hands already moving toward ingredients with the confidence of long practice. "Samantha?"

She stepped to the bench without hesitation, feeling the rightness of the movement in her bones. "Short and tight chalk marks need to set through it," she said, her voice gaining strength from familiar ground. "If the wash leaves a sheen, the chalk will skate. It needs bite."

"Good," Melf said, approval warm in his voice. "Bay oil for bite. A hair. Lareth, hold the hum where it is—no surges. If it scums, we've over-asked the vinegar."

"Holding," Lareth said, his palm settling on the sigil-ring with the steadiness of a man who had learned long ago how to be a living metronome.

Work took them. Not the desperate scramble of the siege, but the focused dance of people who knew their craft and trusted each other to know theirs.

Samantha ground juniper resin with a mortar worn smooth by countless hands stronger than hers. The pestle fit her grip like it had been waiting for her to arrive. She bled vinegar into the mixture with drops that fell like counted coins—each one measured, each one purposeful. The smell rose sharp and clean, cutting through the workshop's other scents like a blade through silk.

*Something stirred beneath her awareness—not sight but sense. Patterns wanting to align, threads of possibility weaving through the work. Her covenant with Valamar had always made her sensitive to the underlying flows, though she'd never learned the scholarly terms for what she felt.*

A student brought bay leaves, their surfaces glossy with oil that caught the light. She cracked one between her nails—the sound crisp as breaking glass—and let the oil thread through the mixture until the consistency shifted from slick to sure. Her hands moved without conscious thought, following patterns learned in quieter laboratories in distant places.

Melf tuned the rune-kiln with fingertip taps that made the copper sing in harmonics that settled in her bones like music. Each note was precise, intentional, part of a larger melody only he could hear. Lareth watched the glyphs with the intensity of a cat watching mice, keeping the working steady through small adjustments that spoke of deep understanding. His eyes tracked something she couldn't see—flows and tensions in the air itself.

*"Lattice Sight,"* Melf murmured, noticing her attention. *"Lareth sees the patterns directly. Useful for keeping teams from cooking themselves when the work gets hot."*

Magic always asked for breath and discipline. Overreach frayed edges or made them bite back through channels never meant to carry such forces. The copper-lightning flavor of power flowed through living flesh, the metallic tang speaking of boundaries tested but not crossed. Her Herald training had taught her to recognize the sensation, though not to name it as these scholars did.

They tested their work on a fouled stave pulled from the wall—old wood blackened with the enemy's grit. The wash turned the contamination to mud that lifted under cloth without scratching the surface beneath. Samantha drew a tightening curve with fresh chalk, feeling it bite the wood like it had been waiting for exactly this shape to make sense again.

"It bites," she said, unable to keep satisfaction from coloring her voice.

"It does," Melf said, his attention focused on scaling the mixture to useful quantities. His hands moved with the precision of someone who had made the same calculations countless times. "We'll need pails and steady hands to carry them. We'll need to teach these marks in three minutes to fingers that feel like they have eight thumbs."

Lareth glanced toward Samantha, something that might have been approval flickering in his expression. "Your five minutes," he said. "Earned sooner with this than any speech."

"I meant to speak first," she admitted, the confession surprising her with its honesty. "I am better when I have said what I came to say."

"You said it," Melf said, his tone mild but certain. "Just not with your mouth."

The door opened with a whisper of hinges that needed oil. The garden's cold made a brief treaty with the workshop's warmth, and in the balance between them the warden in the blue sash appeared. She held out a tin badge stamped with the University's seal—a stylized fjord and three spires that caught the light like promises. "For internal movement," she said. "Don't get lost. People do, even in straight halls, when they're needed in more than one place."

"Hold fast, work true," Samantha said quietly, recognizing the University's motto etched beneath the symbol.

The warden's eyebrows lifted slightly. "Someone did their reading before arriving."

"I always do." Samantha pinned the badge to her cloak with fingers steady despite the morning's trials, feeling something small but significant align in her chest. Not acceptance—not yet. But a place to stand, a foundation from which to build. "A Herald comes prepared."

"Herald?" Melf's voice sharpened with interest. "Of what tradition?"

"Valamar's." She met his gaze directly. "The Platinum Dragon teaches that truth is best proven through service, not proclamation."

Something passed between Lareth and Melf—a quick exchange of glances that spoke of recognition, perhaps even approval. The bells in the city had grown quieter, and steam rose steady where workshop warmth met winter air.

*Five minutes with the triad. It's enough. It has to be enough.*

*But even as relief flickered in her chest, doubt shadowed it. Five minutes to explain a conflict spanning realms. Five minutes to convince them that Erandia wasn't legend, that the threats she warned of were real. Five minutes to find the ally her homeland desperately needed.*

*And beneath it all, the nagging certainty that her true nature—the angelic heritage she herself didn't understand—would complicate any alliance she tried to forge. The signs were subtle but growing stronger: the way ward-magic responded too readily to her touch, the clarity that came when others grew confused and tired.*

*Time would tell if Winter University was prepared for the Herald they'd just accepted.*
