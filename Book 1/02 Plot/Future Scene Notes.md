# Future Scene Notes

## Revised Plot Sequence: Tengus Assault

**Setup from Scene 04:** Tengus gives 3-day ultimatum before beginning his "true working" with the artifacts of Gosh.

### New Sequence of Events:

**Tengus's Solo Mission:**
- Tengus assaults the Administrator alone (not waiting for [[Lareth Lakhart|Lareth]], [[Samantha Seraphel|Samantha]], and [[Melf Maelstorm|Melf]])
- Kills the Administrator and takes the ring/key
- Attempts to access the sealed chamber and retrieve the [[Book of Gosh]] and [[Sword of Gosh]]
- **Encounters the undead dragon** in the chamber
- **Fails to kill the dragon** and cannot complete the seal
- **Retreats**, leaving the ring in the dead Administrator's hand
- Exits to formulate new plans based on what he discovered

**Trio's Later Discovery:**
- [[Lareth Lakhart|Lareth]], [[Samantha Seraphel|Samantha]], and [[Melf Maelstorm|Melf]] will **not** go to the chamber before Lareth has the ring
- They go alone **after** the Administrator's death
- Find the Administrator's body with the ring still in his hand
- Attempt to take the [[Book of Gosh]] themselves
- Must deal with the same undead dragon threat Tengus failed to handle

**Key Changes:**
- Tengus acts independently and discovers the full scope of the chamber's dangers
- The ring remains accessible to the trio after Tengus's failure
- Sets up future conflict where Tengus has knowledge of the dragon threat
- Creates opportunity for Tengus to develop alternative strategies

**Timeline:** Administrator's death → Tengus's failed attempt → Trio's discovery mission

---

*Note: This revision creates more dramatic tension and gives Tengus firsthand knowledge of the chamber's true dangers while preserving the trio's access to the artifacts.*
