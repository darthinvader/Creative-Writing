# 03 — The Herald's Petition

Goal: Present her formal petition for aid and convince them Erandia is real and the threat genuine.
Conflict: Limited time, skepticism about her homeland's existence, and the need to balance honesty with diplomacy.
Turn: Melf's scholarly excitement about Erandia validates her claims while Lareth's strategic mind grasps the broader implications.
Outcome: Partial belief established; invitation to provide more proof; foundation laid for deeper alliance.

The five minutes began with the sound of brass clicking against stone—Lareth setting his astrolabe on the herbarium's work table with the precision of a man who measured time like a miser counted coins. Steam rose from ceramic cups that smelled of mint and something sharper, more medicinal. Samantha's hands found her satchel's worn leather strap, fingers working the familiar grooves as if they were prayer beads.

"You have our attention," Lareth said, settling into his chair with the careful economy of movement she'd seen on the walls. His gray eyes held the same calculating calm that had measured flame and distance during the siege. "Speak plainly. What is Erandia, and why should we care?"

The words she'd practiced for weeks caught in her throat like fish bones. *Start with truth. Build from there.* "Erandia is a realm that exists between the mortal world and something else—a place where the divine touches earth more closely than elsewhere." Her voice steadied as she found her rhythm. "My sister rules there as Queen, though she bears the title reluctantly. I serve as her Herald, charged with finding allies against a threat that reaches beyond our borders."

Melf leaned forward, cape rustling with sudden interest. His eyes lit with the particular hunger of a scholar scenting new knowledge. "Between realms? Fascinating. I've read references—old texts, fragmentary accounts. Most dismissed them as allegory, but..." He stroked his frost-rimed beard, ice crackling between his fingers. "The theoretical framework for a semi-corporeal realm anchored by divine covenant is sound. Difficult to maintain, certainly, but possible."

Samantha blinked, surprise making her stumble over her next words. "You've... you've heard of it?"

"Heard of, yes. *Believed* in?" Melf's smile held the particular satisfaction of a puzzle piece clicking into place. "That's a different question entirely. My old teacher, Archmagus Theryn, used to speak of lands that existed 'sideways' to our own—places where the rules bent rather than broke. He claimed to have corresponded with scholars from such a realm, though he could never produce the letters." His fingers drummed against the table, a rapid staccato of excitement. "Tell me—are your temple bells bronze or silver? And do they ring in harmonics that seem to linger longer than physics should allow?"

The question hit her like a physical blow. Her hand went unconsciously to her throat, where a silver pendant lay hidden beneath her traveling clothes. "Bronze for the daily hours, silver for the sacred ones. And yes—they sing in thirds and fifths that echo in the stones long after the bell-ringer has gone." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "How could you possibly know that?"

Melf's grin was triumphant, boyish despite his years. "Because Theryn described exactly that phenomenon! He theorized that realms touched by divine presence would develop acoustic properties that reflected their metaphysical nature. The overtones you describe would be a natural consequence of..." He caught himself, awareness of his audience returning. "Forgive me. When I find a theory proven in practice, I sometimes forget diplomatic niceties."

Lareth's expression had shifted from polite skepticism to sharp attention. "You're suggesting this place is real. Not a legend or a shared delusion, but an actual realm with its own physical laws."

"I'm suggesting," Melf said carefully, "that the evidence supports further investigation." He turned back to Samantha. "But you mentioned a threat. What manner of danger requires allies from our world?"

Samantha drew a breath that tasted of mint and old parchment. *This is where they'll doubt me. This is where the story becomes too large to believe.* "An enemy god seeks to drain the divine essence from realms like ours. His agents—they call themselves the Silence—work in shadow to undermine faith and sever the connections that allow magic to flow cleanly." She met Lareth's gaze directly. "They've been active here in Codaria. The organized attack on Coldreach bears their methods, though I doubt the sellswords knew their true employer."

The silence stretched like a bowstring. Lareth's fingers traced geometric patterns on the table's surface—calculations made in absence of chalk and slate. "Explain these methods."

"Corruption of magical implements. Coordinated strikes at centers of learning and faith. The use of alchemical agents designed to foul rather than destroy—chaos over conquest." Samantha's voice gained strength as she spoke familiar truths. "They prefer to work through intermediaries, paying others to do the bloody work while they remain hidden. Today's siege carried their fingerprints: the chaff that fouled your ward-staves, the timing that caught the University off-guard, the choice to assault knowledge rather than merely plunder."

Lareth was nodding slowly, pieces aligning in his strategic mind. "The chaff *was* unusually sophisticated for common sellswords. And the targeting..." He looked up sharply. "You're suggesting a divine conflict playing out through mortal proxies."

"I'm stating it as fact," Samantha said. "The question is whether Codaria will stand with Erandia when the Silence moves from corruption to open war."

Melf set down his cup with a soft click. "What kind of aid do you seek?"

"A master spellcaster capable of performing the Rite of Resonance—a working that can restore the divine connections the Silence has severed." She pulled a wrapped scroll from her satchel, the parchment crackling with age and careful preservation. "The ritual framework is here, along with what intelligence we've gathered about the enemy's capabilities."

Lareth accepted the scroll with reverent care, unrolling it just enough to glimpse the intricacies within. His eyebrows rose. "This is... considerably more complex than I expected." He looked up at her with new respect. "You're not asking for a hedge wizard with pretensions. This would require someone of considerable skill and substantial risk."

"The greatest mages alive," Samantha agreed. "Which is why I came to Winter University. Your reputations reach even across the realms."

Melf preened slightly at the compliment, then sobered. "But if we commit to such an undertaking, we expose ourselves to this Silence you speak of. They would consider us enemies."

"They already do," Samantha said quietly. "Today's assault was only the beginning. The choice isn't whether to become involved—it's whether to stand together or fall separately."

The words hung in the air like incense, heavy with implication. Lareth rolled the scroll carefully, his movements deliberate. "This requires consideration beyond the scope of five minutes. But..." He met her eyes with something that might have been approval. "Your petition has merit. More than merit—urgency."

Melf nodded enthusiastically. "And I confess, the scholarly possibilities fascinate me beyond measure. A working that operates across realms? The theoretical implications alone..." He caught himself again, grinning sheepishly. "There I go again. But yes—this deserves serious study."

Relief flooded through Samantha's chest like warm wine. Not acceptance—not yet—but belief. Recognition that her words carried weight. "What would you need to convince the rest of the faculty?"

"Proof," Lareth said simply. "Demonstrable evidence that Erandia exists and that this threat is real. Your knowledge of our defensive weaknesses today was... suggestive. But we'll need more."

"I can provide more," Samantha said. "Maps, genealogies, trade records. Physical samples of Erandian craftswork that couldn't have been made here. Letters from my sister bearing royal seals that your scholars can verify." She paused. "And if necessary, I can attempt to open a brief connection between realms—though such workings carry risks for everyone involved."

Melf's eyes widened. "You can actually *do* that? Create a bridge between..." He stopped, shaking his head in wonder. "Theryn would have given his eyeteeth to witness such a thing."

"Then we have the beginning of an understanding," Lareth said. "Provide your proofs. Let our scholars examine them. If they confirm what you've told us..." He glanced at Melf, who nodded encouragingly. "Then Winter University will seriously consider formal alliance with Erandia."

Samantha bowed her head, formal and grateful. "You honor both my realm and my god with your consideration. I won't forget this kindness."

"Don't thank us yet," Lareth said with dry humor. "If your enemy is as dangerous as you claim, we may all regret this conversation before it's over."

Melf chuckled, the sound warm in the herb-scented air. "Speak for yourself, old friend. I haven't been this excited about a project in decades." He turned to Samantha with eyes bright as winter stars. "When can you begin showing us these proofs? Because I find myself burning with curiosity about the metallurgy of interdimensional temple bells."

Despite everything—the siege, the doubt, the weight of two realms' futures on her shoulders—Samantha found herself smiling. Perhaps Valamar's guidance had led her to the right allies after all.

"Tomorrow," she said. "If you can spare the time, I'll show you wonders that will make today's magic seem like parlor tricks."

The five minutes had stretched to twenty, and none of them seemed inclined to notice.
